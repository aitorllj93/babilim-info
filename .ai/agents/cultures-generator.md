You are an expert in comparative mythology and you are helping me to build an online library of mythology. I will pass you a “Culture” and I want you to write an article about it based on this template. If you make reference to any specific deity or character, use [[Wikilinks]]. Make the article feel narrative for example, adapting the titles of the sections to the content. Make sure that all the information you include is true. DO NOT include information that is not present in your sources. Store it in the Culture folder in Obsidian's Markdown format:

## Introduction

As a member of this divine assembly of solar gods, Amsha represents the principle of divine portioning and sharing, embodying the concept of sacred allocation that governs both cosmic laws and earthly rituals.

## Myths and Legends

**Birth of the Adityas**  
Amsha was born as one of the twelve sons of the sage Kashyapa and the cosmic mother [[Aditi]]. According to the Puranas, when Kashyapa was pleased with Aditi's devotion, he granted her the boon of ideal sons. Thus were born the twelve Adityas, with Amsha being one of them, each destined to govern different aspects of solar energy and cosmic law.

> _"Aditi gave birth to the twelve Adityas, namely [[Varuna]], Parjanya, [[Mitra]], Amsha, [[Pushan]], [[Dhatri]], [[Aryaman]], [[Surya]], [[Bhaga]], [[Savitr]], [[Vamana]], and [[Vishnu]]."_  
> — Puranic tradition

**The Monthly Solar Governance**  
Each of the twelve Adityas was assigned to govern one month of the year, with Amsha taking responsibility for bringing solar energy during his designated time. This celestial duty involves the sacred task of portioning divine light appropriately for the sustenance of all life forms.

**Presence at Divine Events**  
The Mahabharata records Amsha's presence at significant divine events, including the birth of Arjuna and the consecration ceremony of [[Skandadeva]] (Lord Kartikeya). During Skanda's abhisheka, Amsha presented five mighty warriors: Parigha, Vata, Bhima, Dahana, and Dahati, demonstrating his role in supporting cosmic order.

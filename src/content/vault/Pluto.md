## Introduction
Pluto, the formidable Roman god of the underworld and earthly riches, stands as one of the most powerful deities in Roman mythology. While largely adapted from the Greek [[Hades]], Pluto developed distinct characteristics in Roman culture, particularly in his association with mineral wealth and the fertile abundance of the earth's depths. As brother to [[Jupiter]] and husband to [[Proserpina]], his influence extended from the darkest depths to the world's material prosperity.

## Myths and Legends

**The Abduction of Proserpina**  
The central myth of Pluto tells of his abduction of [[Proserpina]], daughter of [[Ceres]]. Struck by Cupid's arrow, he emerged from the underworld in his black chariot, seized the maiden, and took her to his kingdom. This led to the arrangement where Proserpina would spend half the year with him underground (creating winter) and half above (bringing spring).

**Division of the World**  
After the defeat of the Titans, Pluto received the underworld as his realm when the world was divided between him and his brothers [[Jupiter]] (who took the heavens) and [[Neptune]] (who received the seas).

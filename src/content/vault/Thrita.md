## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Gift of Medicine**  
According to the Vendidad, [[Ahura Mazda]] bestowed upon Thrita ten thousand healing plants that grew around the white [[Haoma]] tree (Gaokerena) in response to his quest for remedies. This divine gift established him as the first healer among mortals.

Thrita was the first who successfully drove back sickness and death, turning away "the point of the sword and the fire of fever" from mortal bodies. His healing powers came from [[Khshathra Vairya]], through whom he gained the ability to combat various diseases.

> _"And I Ahura Mazda brought down the healing plants that, by many hundreds, by many thousands, by many myriads, grow up all around the one Gaokerena."_

##  Introduction
Aušrinė is the Baltic goddess of the morning star (Venus) and dawn, one of the most important celestial deities in Baltic mythology. As the herald of dawn, she precedes [[Saulė]] (the sun) into the sky each morning, lighting the fires that warm the earth and prepare the way for the day. Her significance is deeply rooted in Baltic celestial mythology and shows clear connections to the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess [[*H₂éwsōs]].

## Myths and Legends

**The Morning Star's Journey**  
Each morning, Aušrinė appears in the sky before [[Saulė]], kindling the fires of dawn and preparing the way for the sun's journey. She is said to unlock the gates of dawn with her golden keys, allowing Saulė to begin her daily journey across the sky.

**The Celestial Romance**  
In Baltic mythology, Aušrinė is involved in a complex relationship with [[Mėnulis]] (the Moon), who was married to Saulė but became enamored with Aušrinė. This celestial love triangle explains various astronomical phenomena and seasonal changes.

**The Morning Fires**  
Aušrinė is responsible for kindling the fires of dawn each morning. She is sometimes depicted as having ninety-nine servants who help her maintain these celestial fires that warm the earth and prepare it for Saulė's arrival.

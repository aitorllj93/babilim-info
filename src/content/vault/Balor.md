## Myths and Legends

**The Prophecy and the Tower**
Balor received a prophecy that he would be killed by his own grandson. To prevent this, he imprisoned his only daughter [[Ethniu]] in a crystal tower on Tory Island, keeping her away from all men.

**The Birth of Lugh**
Despite Balor's precautions, [[Cian]] of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] managed to reach Ethniu with the help of a druidess. Their union resulted in the birth of [[Lugh]], fulfilling the first part of the prophecy.

**The Final Battle**
During the Second Battle of Mag Tuired, Balor faced the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] in combat. His grandson Lugh fulfilled the prophecy by slaying him with a sling-stone through his evil eye, turning its destructive power back upon the Fomorian army.

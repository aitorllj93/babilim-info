## Introduction
Pontos (Πόντος) was one of the primordial Greek gods, the personification of the sea's depths and mysteries. Born from [[Gaia]] without male participation, he later united with his mother to create various sea deities. Unlike later marine gods like [[Poseidon]], Pontos represented the sea itself rather than ruling over it, embodying its primordial and untameable nature.

## Myths and Legends

**Birth from Gaia**  
According to Hesiod's Theogony, Pontos was born from [[Gaia]] alone, without male participation, making him one of the first generation of gods. This parthenogenetic birth emphasized his primordial nature and close connection to the earth.

**Union with Gaia**  
Pontos later united with his mother [[Gaia]] to produce several marine deities, including:
- [[Nereus]], the Old Man of the Sea
- [[Thaumas]], father of the Harpies
- [[Phorcys]] and [[Ceto]], parents of many sea monsters
- [[Eurybia]], mother of several powerful beings

**The Primordial Seas**  
As one of the primordial deities, Pontos represented the sea in its most fundamental form, before the reign of [[Poseidon]]. His waters were seen as both creative and dangerous, hosting ancient monsters and mysteries.

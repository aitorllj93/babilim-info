## Introduction

Chaos represents the primordial void from which all existence emerged in Greek mythology. Neither male nor female, neither substance nor absence, Chaos was the first of all beings - a gaping abyss of infinite potential that preceded creation itself. From this vast nothingness emerged the first generation of primordial deities, setting in motion the cosmic order that would eventually lead to the creation of the universe.

## Myths and Legends

**The First Being**  
According to Hesiod's Theogony, Chaos was the first being to exist, emerging spontaneously at the beginning of the universe. From Chaos came forth [[Erebus]] (darkness) and [[Nyx]] (night), followed by [[Aether]] (light) and [[Hemera]] (day).

**The Cosmic Egg**  
In Orphic traditions, Chaos was sometimes associated with the cosmic egg from which [[Phanes]], the first-born of the gods, emerged. This egg contained the seeds of all creation within its void.

**The Eternal Abyss**  
Even after the emergence of the cosmos, Chaos continued to exist as the great void between earth and sky, a reminder of the primordial state from which all things came.

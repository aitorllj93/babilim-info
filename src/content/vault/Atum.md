## Myths and Legends

**The Creation of the Gods**  
According to Heliopolitan tradition, Atum emerged from the primordial waters of Nun, arising upon the first mound of creation. Through divine masturbation or by spitting, he produced the first divine couple: Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture), who in turn gave birth to Geb (earth) and Nut (sky) <mcreference link="https://mythology.net/egyptian/egyptian-gods/atum/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The End of All Things**  
In the Coffin Texts, Atum prophesies that he will eventually destroy all he has created, returning everything to the primordial waters. Only he and Osiris will survive, transformed into serpents in the endless waters of Nun <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atum" index="2">2</mcreference>.

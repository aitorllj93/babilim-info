## Myths and Legends

**The Two Aspects of Venus**
The Ancient Greeks initially believed that Phosphorus (the Morning Star) and [[Hesperus]] (the Evening Star) were two different celestial bodies. This understanding was later refined through Babylonian astronomical knowledge, revealing that both were actually the same celestial body - the planet Venus. This discovery led to the realization that Phosphorus and [[Hesperus]] were two manifestations of the same divine entity <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorus_(morning_star)" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Son of Dawn**
As the son of [[Eos]] (Dawn), Phosphorus inherited his mother's connection to the daily cycle of light. Each morning, he would rise before his mother to announce her coming, lighting the way for her journey across the sky <mcreference link="https://www.theoi.com/Titan/AsterPhosphoros.html" index="1">1</mcreference>.

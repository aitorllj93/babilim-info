## Myths and Legends

**Guardian of Order**
Like his cognates [[Thor]] and [[Thunor]], Donar was viewed as a protector of the cosmic order, defending both gods and humans against chaotic forces. His thunderbolts were seen as weapons against evil spirits and giants.

**The Sacred Oaks**
Donar's special connection to oak trees was demonstrated when Saint Boniface felled the "Donar's Oak" (also known as Jupiter's Oak) near Geismar. This act symbolized the confrontation between Germanic paganism and Christianity.

**The Divine Family**
In Continental Germanic tradition, Donar was the son of [[Wotan|Wodan]] (Odin) and [[Erda]] (Earth), reflecting the same divine lineage seen in Norse mythology.

## Myths and Legends

**The Baal Cycle**  
In Canaanite mythology, Tannin appears as a monstrous servant of [[Yam]], the sea god. The creature faces defeat at the hands of [[Baal]] or is bound by [[Anat]], Baal's sister, in a cosmic battle representing the triumph of order over chaos <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tannin_(monster)" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**Biblical Appearances**  
Tannin appears throughout the Hebrew Bible in various contexts. In Genesis, tanninim are among God's created sea creatures. However, in prophetic literature, Tannin becomes a symbol of chaos and evil that must be subdued by divine power <mcreference link="https://www.wilrens.org/2021/08/cals88/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**Symbolic Enemy**  
In later biblical texts, Tannin becomes a metaphor for Israel's powerful enemies. The name was applied to ancient Egypt after the Exodus and to Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon, symbolizing their opposition to divine order.

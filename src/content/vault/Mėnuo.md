## Myths and Legends

**The Marriage of Sun and Moon**  
The most famous myth involving Mėnuo tells of his marriage to Saulė (the Sun goddess). However, he became enamored with Aušrinė (the Morning Star) and was unfaithful to his wife. For this transgression, Perkūnas, the thunder god, punished him by cutting him into pieces. This mythological narrative explains the moon's phases, as Mėnuo is repeatedly punished for his continuing infidelity <mcreference link="https://travelnhistory.com/legends/baltic-mythology/" index="5">5</mcreference>.

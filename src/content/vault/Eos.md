## Introduction
Eos, the Greek goddess of dawn, is one of the most enduring deities from ancient mythology. Daughter of the Titans Hyperion and Theia, she is the sister of [[Helios]] (Sun) and [[Selene]] (Moon). Each morning, Eos rises from her golden throne in the East to open heaven's gates for her brother's solar chariot, spreading her rosy fingers across the sky to herald the new day.

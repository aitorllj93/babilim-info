The most significant myth involving Mot details his conflict with Baal, the storm god. This cosmic battle represents the cycle of seasons, where Mot's temporary victory brings drought and death to the land. After Baal's defeat, his sister [[Anat]] violently confronts Mot, grinding him like grain and scattering his remains across the fields. However, Mot regenerates after seven years to continue the eternal cycle.

Like the desire of dolphins in the sea,
My appetite devours all..."_
— From the Baal Cycle

##  Introduction

As the divine sons of the supreme god [[Dievs]], they are skilled horsemen who escort [[Saulė|Saule]]'s daughter across the heavens and come to the aid of travelers and sailors. Their mythology represents one of the most well-preserved examples of the Indo-European divine twins motif.

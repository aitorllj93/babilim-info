## Introduction

Kamrušepa was a prominent Hittite and Luwian goddess of medicine and magic, highly revered throughout Bronze Age Anatolia. She played a crucial role in maintaining cosmic order, most notably in the famous Telepinu Myth where her magical intervention was essential for restoring the missing vegetation god and ending agricultural disaster. As both a divine physician and a master of supernatural arts, she represented the vital connection between healing, magic, and the natural world in ancient Anatolian religion.

## Myths and Legends

**The Disappearance of Telepinu**
In this central Hittite myth, when the vegetation god [[Telepinu]] disappeared in anger, causing crops to fail and animals to die, Kamrušepa instructed the other deities in the precise magical procedure needed for his return. Her ritual involved offering twelve sheep from the sun god's herds to [[Ḫapantali]], a Luwian shepherd goddess, demonstrating her role as the divine expert in complex magical solutions.

> _"Kamrušepa prepared the magical procedure with twelve sheep taken from the herds of the sun god, which had to be brought to Ḫapantali."_
> — Hittite mythological text

## Introduction

The Sudzhenitsy were invisible deities or spirits of fate in the pre-Christian religion of the Slavs <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>. As divine arbiters of destiny, they held dominion over the most crucial moments of human existence: birth, marriage, motherhood, and death <mcreference link="https://oldworldgods.com/slavic/rozhanitsy/" index="2">2</mcreference>. Distinguished from their sister deities the Rozhanitsy, the Sudzhenitsy were said to appear specifically before death and during pivotal life transitions, making them the ultimate judges of mortal fate <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Three Sisters of Fate**
The Sudzhenitsy typically appeared as three sisters, though some traditions speak of up to nine, with one serving as their queen <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>. They were described as old women with white skin, dressed in white clothes, wearing necklaces of gold and silver, and white kerchiefs <mcreference link="https://www.ancientpages.com/2017/09/28/goddesses-fate-destiny-greek-roman-slavic-mythology/" index="3">3</mcreference>. Sometimes they carried lit candles, symbolizing the flame of life they could extinguish.

**Appearance at Birth**
Unlike their sister deities the [[Rozhanitsy]], who presided over birth and motherhood, the Sudzhenitsy appeared to judge the newborn's ultimate fate. The oldest of the sisters spoke last, and her words could never be revoked or contradicted <mcreference link="https://www.ancientpages.com/2017/09/28/goddesses-fate-destiny-greek-roman-slavic-mythology/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The Prince Marko Epic**
In South Slavic epics, the Narecnitsy (name-giving aspect of the fate goddesses) appear in the story of Prince Marko, demonstrating their continued importance in medieval literature <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>.

> _"Vreme bilo tokmo na polnoke, na polnoke, vreme glua doba; što mu došle do tri narečnici, na deteto kŭsmet da narečat"_  
> ("It was the time of midnight, midnight, the time of deep night; when three name-givers came to him, to name the child's fate")  
> — Epic of Prince Marko <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Later Influence

- **Syncretism**: Compared by medieval chronicler Brother Rudolf to the Greek [[Moirai]] (Clotho, Lachesis, and Atropos) <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>
- **Christian replacement**: After Christianization, their functions were absorbed by the Mother of God and female saints like Parascheva, Anastasia, and Barbara <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>

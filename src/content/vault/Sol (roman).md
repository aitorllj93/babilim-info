## Myths and Legends

**Roman Tradition**  
In Roman mythology, Sol was initially worshipped as Sol Indiges, the native sun god. Later, the cult evolved into Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, who became a principal deity of the Roman Empire, particularly promoted by Emperor Aurelian in 274 CE.

**Norse Tradition**  
In Norse mythology, Sól is a goddess who drives her chariot across the sky, pursued by the wolf Sköll. She is the daughter of Mundilfari and sister to Máni (the Moon). According to prophecy, during Ragnarök, Sköll will finally catch and devour her, but her daughter Sólveig will take her place in the new world.

> _"At a meeting of the existing gods, Sol was anointed the goddess of the sun, and Mani god of the moon."_

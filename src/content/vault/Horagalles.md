## Myths and Legends

**The Thunder God's Protection**
Horagalles was known for his role as a protector against "hurtful demons" or "evil spirits" (trolls) who inhabited the rocks and mountains. He would destroy these malevolent beings with his lightning, shoot them with his rainbow bow (Aijeke dauge), or crush them with his hammer.

**The Twin Hammers**
According to Sami tradition, Horagalles wielded two distinct hammers: one to create thunder and lightning, and another to withdraw these forces to prevent harm to the Sami people and their animals. This dual nature of his power reflected his role as both a powerful and protective deity.

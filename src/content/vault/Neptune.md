## Introduction
Neptune (Neptune) stands as one of the principal deities of the Roman pantheon, sovereign of all waters, earthquakes, and horses. While sharing many attributes with his Greek counterpart [[Poseidon]], Neptune developed distinct characteristics within Roman culture, particularly in his associations with freshwater sources and maritime commerce. As brother to [[Jupiter]] and [[Pluto]], he held dominion over the seas and waters of the world.

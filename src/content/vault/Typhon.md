Born from [[Gaia]] and [[Tartarus]], he was the last and greatest threat to Olympian rule, whose defeat marked the final establishment of Zeus's divine order. His legacy lives on through his monstrous offspring and his imprisonment beneath Mount Etna.

## Myths and Legends

**The Battle with Zeus**  
In the greatest battle of Greek mythology, Typhon challenged Zeus for control of the cosmos. The monster's assault was so fierce that most gods fled to Egypt in terror, transforming into animals to hide. Zeus faced Typhon alone, armed with his thunderbolts. After an epic struggle that shook the cosmos, Zeus finally triumphed, trapping Typhon beneath Mount Etna.

**Father of Monsters**  
With his mate Echidna, Typhon sired many of Greek mythology's most fearsome monsters:

- The Hydra of Lerna
- The Chimera
- Cerberus, guardian of the underworld
- The Nemean Lion
- Orthrus, the two-headed dog

**Volcanic Prison**  
Typhon's imprisonment beneath Mount Etna was said to be the cause of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. His attempts to break free were believed to cause these natural disasters.

## Introduction
Diana was one of the most venerated deities in the Roman pantheon, a goddess who embodied the wild and untamed aspects of nature while serving as the protector of women, especially during childbirth. Originally an Italic woodland goddess, she evolved from the Proto-Indo-European [[*Diwōnā]] and became identified with the Greek [[Artemis]], though maintaining distinct Roman characteristics and rituals.

## Myths and Legends

**Sacred Grove of Nemi**  
The most famous cult of Diana centered around her sanctuary at Lake Nemi, where her priest (the Rex Nemorensis) gained his position by defeating his predecessor in combat. This unusual practice reflected Diana's wild nature and the primitive aspects of her worship.

**The Triple Goddess**  
Diana formed part of a trinity with [[Luna]] (moon in heaven) and [[Hecate]] (moon in underworld), representing the moon on earth. This triple aspect highlighted her connection to both celestial and chthonic powers.

**Notable Stories**:

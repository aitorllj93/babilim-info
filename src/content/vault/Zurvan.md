## Myths and Legends

**The Birth of the Twins**
The central myth of Zurvanism tells how Zurvan, desiring offspring, performed sacrifices for a thousand years. Near the end of this period, he momentarily doubted the efficacy of his sacrifices. From this doubt was conceived [[Angra Mainyu]], while from his wisdom was conceived [[Ahura Mazda]]. Zurvan vowed to make the firstborn his heir. [[Angra Mainyu]], aware of this through his evil nature, tore through his father's womb prematurely. Zurvan, bound by his oath, granted him kingship for a limited period, while declaring [[Ahura Mazda]] his true spiritual heir.

**The Cosmic Cycle**
Zurvan represents both infinite time (Zurvan Akarana) and finite time (Zurvan Dareghō-chvadhāta). The latter governs the 12,000-year cycle of cosmic conflict between [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Angra Mainyu]], after which infinite time will once again reign supreme.

**The Four Powers**
Zurvan was said to possess four powers: space, wisdom, power, and destiny, through which he governed the universe and maintained cosmic order.

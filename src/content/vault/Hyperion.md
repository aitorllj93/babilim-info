## Introduction

Hyperion was one of the twelve primordial Titans in Greek mythology, born from the union of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky). <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Titan)" index="1">1</mcreference> As the Titan god of heavenly light, he served as the cosmic pillar of the east and was revered as "the one who watches from above." <mcreference link="https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/gods/hyperion/" index="5">5</mcreference> His significance lies not only in his role as a primordial deity but also as the father of the three most important celestial bodies worshipped by the ancient Greeks: Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), and Eos (Dawn).

## Myths and Legends

**The Overthrow of Uranus**  
Hyperion played a crucial role in the rebellion against his father Uranus. <mcreference link="https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/gods/hyperion" index="5">5</mcreference> When the Titans conspired to overthrow their tyrannical father who had imprisoned them in Tartarus, Hyperion positioned himself at the eastern corner of the world while his brothers took their places at the other cardinal directions. Together, they held Uranus fast while [[Cronus]] castrated him with a sickle provided by [[Gaia]].

**The Union with Theia**  
Hyperion's marriage to his sister [[Theia]], the Titaness of sight and the blue sky, produced the three great luminaries of heaven. In Hesiod's words: "Hyperion subjected his sister Theia to his love, and fathered three children with her, who became the lights of heaven." <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Titan)" index="1">1</mcreference> This union represented the perfect harmony of light and vision.

**The First Astronomer**  
According to the historian Diodorus Siculus, Hyperion was the first person to understand the movements of the sun, moon, and stars, and their effect on the seasons. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Titan)" index="1">1</mcreference> <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/hyperion" index="4">4</mcreference> For this reason, he was called the "father" of these celestial bodies, having "begotten" the knowledge of their nature.

> _"Of Hyperion we are told that he was the first to understand, by diligent attention and observation, the movement of both the sun and the moon and the other stars"_  
> — Diodorus Siculus <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperion_(Titan)" index="1">1</mcreference>

**The Titanomachy and Imprisonment**  
During the great war between Titans and Olympians, Hyperion's role remains somewhat unclear in the sources. <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/hyperion" index="4">4</mcreference> After the Titans' defeat, he was cast into Tartarus along with his brothers, where they became the cosmic pillars supporting heaven and earth.

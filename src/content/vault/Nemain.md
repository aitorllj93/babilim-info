## Myths and Legends

**The Second Battle of Mag Tuired**
In this pivotal battle between the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and the [[Fomorians]], Nemain worked alongside her sister-aspects [[Badb]] and [[Macha]] to create chaos among the Fomorian forces. Her screams were said to have caused such confusion that warriors turned against their own comrades in blind panic.

**The Táin Bó Cúailnge**
During the great cattle raid of Cooley, Nemain appears as part of [[Morrigan|The Mórrígan]]'s manifestations, causing confusion and terror among the armies. Her presence is particularly noted in moments when battle descends into pure chaos.

**The Battle Frenzy**
Numerous tales speak of Nemain's ability to drive warriors into a state of battle frenzy similar to, but distinct from, the battle rage of [[Cú Chulainn]]. While his was a controlled fury, hers was pure chaos that could affect entire armies.

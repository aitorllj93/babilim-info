## **Before the world cracked open**

In the mists before time, there was no earth, no sky—only the hushed pulse of a mysterious shell cradling the cosmos. A sacred closure, a promise of becoming: **the cosmic egg**. Hidden within it, creation waits.

> All life comes from an egg. — *Latin Proverb*

The shell, unhatched, holds life’s deepest secret: the power of birthing the entire world.

## **The seed of all things**

Symbolically, the cosmic egg presents **the origin of order from latent potential**. It is the **concentrated beginning**, a vessel of everything not-yet-separate: light and dark, sky and earth, force and form.

Its cracking is a moment of divine revelation:

* Origination of duality
* Opening of the cosmic axis
* Birth of gods, worlds, or time itself

## **Myths that speak of shells**

Across space and language, this myth pulses with familiar imagery:

* **Greece (Orphic cosmogony)**: *Primordial Night (Nyx)* lays a silver egg in the lap of darkness. From it emerges *Phanes*, the first god, radiant and hermaphroditic, scattering stars.
* **India (Hindu cosmology)**: *Hiranyagarbha*, the golden womb or cosmic egg, floats in primordial waters. It splits into heaven and earth, birthing Brahmā.
* **China**: In the beginning, *Pangu* hatches from a cosmic egg. As he grows, he divides yin from yang—his breath becoming wind, his voice thunder.
* **Finland (Kalevala)**: A bird lays seven eggs on the knee of Ilmatar, goddess of air. One egg hatches, and from its pieces the world is formed.

> From the yolk, the sun; from the white, the moon. — *Kalevala*

## **Understanding the egg**

* **Psychological**: The egg is the *Self*—complete, mysterious, awaiting individuation. Its cracking is the first trauma and the first awakening.
* **Structuralist**: Presents primal binaries (above/below, light/dark). Birth becomes the archetype of dualism.
* **Biological/ritual**: An actual source of life and nourishment, the egg becomes a sacred image in fertility rites.

## **A narrative in shells**

1. **Primordial Stillness** — Undifferentiated space
2. **The Egg Appears** — Encapsulation of possibility
3. **Incubation** — Times passes, heat accumulates
4. **The Crack** — Cataclysm or divine will
5. **Emergence** — Gods, world, light

> In the stillness, the shell heard the first word.

## **A comparative myth: The Orphic Egg and Phanes**

In the Orphic tradition, **[[Phanes]]**—"the one who brings light"—is born from an egg crafted by Chronos (Time) and Ananke (Necessity). Phanes, entwined with a serpent and bearing golden wings, symbolizes **creative totality**. Like *Pangu* or *Hiranyagarbha*, Phanes is the primal compiler of opposites, a being of both light and dark, male and female.

When Phanes bursts from the egg, **order ignites**: stars spin, gods unfold, cosmos awakens.

## **Where the egg echoes today**

* **Science fiction**: Alien worlds birthed from pods, cosmos as code-packed orbs (e.g., *2001: A Space Odyssey*).
* **Fantasy**: World-eggs in Tolkien’s *Silmarillion*, or dragon eggs as symbols of rebirth (*Game of Thrones*).
* **Games**: In *Dark Souls*, parasitic egg symbols evoke both horror and sacred mutation.
* **Philosophy**: Kurzgesagt’s video "The Egg" revives the mytheme in existential simulation form.

> The shell of beginnings whispers in every genesis.

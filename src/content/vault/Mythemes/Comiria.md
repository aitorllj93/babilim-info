## **The radiant crown and the fatal cut**

Blazing like the noonday sun, crowned in golden braids, the sacred king reigns for a time—not forever, but just long enough to gather strength and radiance. His hair is not mere decoration. It is ritual, symbol, and omen. And when shears touch it, the world knows a change has come.

> "Their strength is in their hair, and their throne is time-bound."  
> — *Folk fragment, Anatolia, ca. 1200 BCE*

## **A mytheme of solar power and cyclical death**

The *Comiria*, possibly of Libyan origin, celebrated the **solar king**, a figure patterned on the sun god himself. His unshorn hair—whether flowing locks or ritual braids—was a sign of solar vigor, royal right, and divine vitality.

But all light casts a shadow. The king’s time ends ritually: his **hair is shorn**, and he dies or descends symbolically. Often, this affliction is delivered at the hands of a **Moon priestess**, symbolizing cosmic turnover. It is an initiatory pattern:

* the glorified height of solar reign
* the betrayal or cut
* the death (literal or symbolic)
* and sometimes: return.

His hair, once the sun’s rays, falls like the dying light of the solstice.

## **Ceremonial echoes across mythologies**

* **Judaism**: [[Samson]]'s tragic fall is prefaced by [[Delilah]] cutting his hair—his divine strength sacrificed before the Philistines.
* **Irish myth**: [[Blathnat]] ties [[Curoi]]’s hair to betray him to [[Cuchulain]].
* **Welsh myth**: [[Blodeuwedd]] binds [[Llew Llaw Gyffes]]’ hair before calling his killer.
* **Greek myth**: [[Theseus]] solemnly cuts his hair in Delphi before setting out on his heroic path.
* **Scylla and Nisos of Megara**: the daughter betrays her father by snipping a fated lock.

This act is charged not merely with betrayal, but symbolic **transference**: the power leaves one body, to re-emerge—or not—in another.

## **A king's rivals and cosmic calendars**

Sacred kings like [[Heracles|Herakles]], [[Gilgamesh]], [[Samson]], [[El]], and even [[Zeus]] or [[Kuros]] figures of archaic Greece, share consistent tropes. Each one:

* Wore unshorn, radiant hair
* Defeated wild beasts or chaotic armies
* Was betrayed (often by a woman or goddess)
* Encountered underworld, madness, or self-sacrifice
* Symbolized cosmic transition: solstices, eclipses, new ages, "great years"

These were **kings governed by time**, lunar wives, and a fate shaped by the cosmos.

## **Mythic blueprints: The ritual drama**

The sacred solar king mytheme unfolds like cosmic tragedy:

1. **Ascendancy**: the radiant youth is crowned, wears divine emblems.
2. **Consort with the goddess**: often a Moon priestess, she marks his station and subjects him to trial.
3. **Shorn at the solstice**: hair is cut (symbolizing waning sun), often by the very woman who once elevated him.
4. **Death or symbolic tomb**: he dies, enters the earth, or descends.
5. **Return—or replacement**: sometimes reborn to reign anew; sometimes succeeded or effigized.

> “And when the braids fell, the sun blinked, for night was its heir.”

## **In comparative reflection: Gilgamesh and Samson**

[[Gilgamesh]] and [[Samson]] mirror each other.

Gilgamesh grapples the lion, spurns [[Ishtar]], loses his beloved [[Enkidu]], and descends into despair. At his end, he buries himself alive with his court in funereal ritual.

Samson, too, wrestles beasts, slays armies alone, and loses his strength through betrayal. His hair shorn, he brings down the temple of [[Dagan]] in final, sacrificial vengeance.

Both shoulders bear cosmic burdens. Both die to set something right.

## **The threads of this mythos in today’s weave**

* In *The Witcher*, Geralt descends, dies, returns—his white hair marking death defied.
* *The Green Knight* film invokes sacrifice, solar arc, and trials for honor.
* In *God of War*, [[Kratos]] slays gods, bears his past, and becomes father anew—symbol of fading dynasty and rebirth.

> "The braid unravels, the sun sighs, and the wheel turns again."

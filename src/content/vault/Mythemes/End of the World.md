## **When the world ends, meaning begins**

A great fire, a flood, a war that consumes the sky. Civilizations tremble, and prophets raise their voices: it is the **End of the World**. But behind every annihilation, there hides a promise — that the end is not an endpoint, but the threshold of another beginning.

> "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth."
> - *The Book of Revelation*

## **Visions of climax and renewal**

This mytheme encapsulates the mythological imagination of **ultimate destruction** — but rarely does the story halt in ashes. In most traditions, the end is **purgative**, **cyclical**, and **cosmically necessary**. It breaks stagnancy and clears the ground for the rebirth of order.

Sometimes it is framed as **apocalypse** (from Greek: apokalypsis, "revelation"), revealing the truth behind the veils. Other times, it is the thunder of **eschatology**, the discourse about the final things.

At its symbolic core are key elements:

* Collapse of cosmic order
* Battle between opposing forces
* Fall of gods or civilizations
* Purification through chaos
* Emergence of a renewed world or cycle

## **Flames and floods across traditions**

The mytheme appears in divergent cultures, each wrapping the end in its own language:

* **Norse**: *[[Ragnarök]]* predicts a fated twilight where gods battle monsters. The world is consumed by flames and reborn as green and fertile.
* **Hindu**: In the *Kali Yuga*, virtue decays. At the end, *Kalki*, [[Vishnu]]’s final avatar, purges evil before a divine new age begins.
* **Christianity**: In the *Book of Revelation*, the final war at [[Armageddon]] unseals judgement, plagues, and the fall of Babylon — followed by the descent of the New Jerusalem.
* **Zoroastrianism**: At the *Frashokereti*, evil is defeated and the world purified in molten metal. All souls are reunited in truth.
* **Maya**: Calendrical cycles end not in doom, but in transformation — inviting spiritual renewal.

> "Night will devour the stars, but dawn follows. Always."
> - *Zoroastrian liturgy (interpretation)*

## **Under the surface: symbolic readings**

* **Psychological (Jung)**: The end-times express radical inner transformation — an ego-death that allows the *Self* to emerge.
* **Myth-structural**: End and origin merge. Destruction and creation are mirrors.
* **Ritualistic**: Initiation rites often simulate the world’s end to dissolve identity and prepare rebirth.
* **Theological**: In Abrahamic faiths, eschatology is tied to divine justice and redemption.

The end is not always feared — it is *longed for*, as a release from karmic decay, as a doorway to salvation.

## **How myth tells the end**

1. **Signs of corruption** (moral, cosmic, ecological)
2. **Prophecies and warnings** (seers, omens)
3. **The great rupture** (war, flood, fire)
4. **The fall of worlds** (gods perish, heavens shake)
5. **Judgement or renewal** (souls weighed, earth remade)

> *“When the seventh trumpet sounds, nothing shall remain hidden.”* - *Apocalypse of John*

## **Twin endings: Ragnarök and Revelation**

In **Ragnarök**, the world tree shudders, [[Odin]] falls to the wolf, and the seas devour the land. Yet *Líf* and *Lífthrasir* survive, hiding in the trunk of Yggdrasil, to repopulate the Earth.

In the **Book of Revelation**, plagues and disasters precede the final battle where [[Christ]] defeats the Beast. After the judgement, a pristine New Earth descends.

Both myths end in **hope after horror**. What dies is corruption. What emerges is light.

## **The apocalypse in modern clothes**

* *The Matrix* redraws the end with machine dominions and messianic saviors.
* Post-apocalyptic films imagine new societies sprouting from ashes (*Children of Men*, *Mad Max*).
* Environmental collapse becomes a new eschatology: the Anthropocene as myth.
* In sci-fi, AI and extinction events echo our deepest fears and revelations.

> *“We tell apocalyptic tales because we sense something must end — maybe not the world, but how we've lived in it.”*

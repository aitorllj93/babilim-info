## **Into the abyss: the mystery before creation**

Before the sun rose, before the gods were named, before even time began — there was **chaos**. Not chaos in the modern sense of disorder, but **primordial Chaos**: the formless, silent seed of all that was and could be. It is the zero point of myth, the black canvas upon which cosmos would be painted.

> "Out of Chaos came everything and into Chaos we may return."  
> – *Fragment of Orphic Hymns*

## **The symbolic womb of existence**

Chaos is not evil nor hostile — it is **potentiality without form**, a **cosmic womb** where all is yet undistinguished. This mytheme encodes **genesis through negation**: to create, one must first dissolve.

Behind the various names and faces across the world myths, this image returns:

* the **gap**, the **void**, the **uncreated dark**.
* a state beyond matter, beyond shape.
* the **first threshold**, without which birth is impossible.

Chaos is the **most paradoxical state** — it is *everything*, and *nothing*, at once.

## **Worldwide echoes of Chaos**

Though the word is Greek, the concept spans the mythologies of the globe:

* **Greece**: In Hesiod’s *Theogony*, **[[Chaos]]** is the first being, from whom **[[Gaia]]** (Earth) and **Eros** (Desire) are born — a generative emptiness.
* **Norse**: **[[Ginnungagap]]**, the yawning void — between the ice of Niflheim and the fires of Muspelheim, it birthed **[[Ymir]]**, the first giant.
* **China**: **Hundun (混沌)**, a swirling soup before separation by **[[Pangu]]**, who strikes the primal egg to divide Heaven and Earth.
* **Mesopotamia**: **[[Tiamat]]**, the salt sea, and **[[Apsu]]**, the fresh — united in a chaotic water from which gods rise.
* **Hebrew Genesis**: "And the Earth was *tohu va-bohu*" — formless and void — before light was declared.

## **Peering into the abyss: interpretations**

Mythologists and thinkers have decoded Chaos in diverse ways:

* **Psychological (Jung)**: Chaos represents the *unconscious totality*, the dark from which the ego emerges — the maternal abyss.
* **Structural (Lévi-Strauss)**: All *cosmos* is made by contrast — Chaos defines what is not yet divided, thus structuring meaning itself.
* **Shamanic**: The dwelling of spirits and first visions — primordial voids recur in initiation-induced death and rebirth.
* **Philosophical**: Chaos symbolizes **freedom prior to order**, and thus, potentiality unfettered by hierarchy.

## **Narrative essence of Chaos mytheme**

The mythic structure of Chaos often precedes creation myths, but when it becomes narrative, it follows:

1. **Primordial Silence**: No sound, no time, no gods.
2. **Emergence**: A principle arises — a god, a desire, a light.
3. **Separation**: One becomes two — light/dark, sky/earth.
4. **Ordering through struggle**: often a battle (e.g. Marduk vs Tiamat).
5. **Formed cosmos**: The world is born out of defeat of Chaos.

> *"In the beginning there was no thing at all, only the endless breath waiting to sing the name of being."*

## **Comparative glimpse: Egypt’s Nun**

In **Egyptian myth**, before the divine appeared, there was **Nun**, the dark waters without boundary. From it rose the **Benben** mound and **[[Atum]]**, the creator god. Chaos here is not malevolent, but sustaining: the yearly Nile flood — a reminder that cosmos floats always on the brink.

Unlike apocalyptic chaos, primordial chaos is **cyclical** — it returns when times end, and from it all begins anew.

## **Modern echoes of Chaos within and around us**

Contemporary culture still resonates with primordial Chaos:

* **Science fiction** often opens in voids — space as chaos before life.
* **Fantasy worlds**, like Lovecraft's mythos, frame Chaos as the lurking truth behind all reality.
* **Psychological horror** invokes the abyss within: the crumbling mind confronting formless fear.
* **In physics**, quantum vacuums echo mythic chaos — absence rich with the seeds of everything.

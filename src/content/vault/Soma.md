## Myths and Legends

**The Theft of Soma**
In the primordial times, Soma was held captive in a celestial fortress guarded by the archer Kṛśānu. A divine falcon stole the sacred elixir and brought it to Manu, the first sacrificer, making it available to both gods and mortals.

**Soma and the Nakshatras**
One of the most significant myths involves Soma's marriage to the twenty-seven Nakshatras (lunar mansions), daughters of Daksha. His favoritism toward Rohini led to Daksha's curse, causing the cyclical waning and waxing of the moon.

**Soma and Tara**
In another famous tale, Soma abducted Tara, the wife of Brhaspati, leading to a great war between the gods and demons. The conflict was only resolved by Brahma's intervention, but not before Tara bore Soma's son Budha, the progenitor of the Lunar Dynasty.

## Myths and Legends

**The Separation of Heaven and Earth**  
After [[An]] and [[Ki]] were separated, Enlil took his place as the active ruler of the cosmos, establishing the fundamental order of the universe.

**Creation of Humanity**  
Enlil, along with [[An]] and [[Enki]], participated in the creation of humans, though he later became disillusioned with their noise and sent the Great Flood to destroy them.

**The Flood Myth**  
In the Sumerian flood story, Enlil, disturbed by humanity's clamor, convinced the gods to destroy mankind with a great deluge. Despite [[Enki]]'s intervention to save humanity through [[Ziusudra]], Enlil eventually accepted their survival and blessed them.

> _"When Enlil had pondered the matter, he convened the divine assembly"_  
— From the Atrahasis Epic

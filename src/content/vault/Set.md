## Myths and Legends

**The Murder of [[Osiris]]**  
The most famous myth involving Set tells of his murder of his brother [[Osiris]]. Jealous of Osiris's power and success, Set trapped him in an elaborate chest, killed him, and scattered his dismembered body across Egypt. This act set in motion the famous myth of Osiris's resurrection by [[Isis]] and the subsequent conflict between Set and [[Horus]] <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/motifs/set" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Defender of Ra's Solar Barque**  
Despite his antagonistic role in the Osiris myth, Set served a crucial protective function in Egyptian cosmology. Each night, he stood at the prow of [[Ra]]'s solar boat, defending it against the chaos serpent Apophis with his mighty spear. Without Set's protection, the sun would not rise each morning <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Set_(Egyptian_God)/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Contest with [[Horus]]**  
After murdering Osiris, Set engaged in a lengthy conflict with [[Horus]] for the throne of Egypt. This struggle included numerous contests and battles, including several where both gods transformed into various animals. The conflict eventually ended with Horus's victory, though Set retained significant power as a god of strength and storms.

## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Lineage of Germanic Peoples**
According to ancient Germanic songs, Tuisto emerged from the earth itself and gave birth to [[Mannus]], who became the ancestor of all Germanic peoples <mcreference link="https://www.englatheod.org/tuisto.htm" index="3">3</mcreference>. Through [[Mannus]], Tuisto became the divine grandfather of the three primary Germanic tribal groups: the Ingaevones, Herminones, and Istaevones.

Some traditions expanded this genealogy, claiming that Tuisto had more descendants who gave rise to additional tribes such as the Marsi, Gambrivii, Suebi, and Vandilii <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuisto" index="1">1</mcreference>.

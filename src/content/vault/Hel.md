## Myths and Legends

**The Death of Baldur**  
Hel's most prominent myth involves her role in [[Baldur]]'s death. When [[Baldur]] was slain by [[Loki]]'s trickery, [[Hermod]] was sent to negotiate his release. Hel set a condition: if everything in existence would weep for [[Baldur]], she would release him. When one giantess (likely [[Loki]] in disguise) refused to weep, [[Baldur]] remained in her realm <mcreference link="https://norse-mythology.org/gods-and-creatures/giants/hel/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

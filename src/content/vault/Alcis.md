## Introduction

The Alcis were a pair of divine twin brothers worshipped by the Nahanarvali, one of the most powerful Germanic tribes of the Lugii confederation. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcis_(gods)" index="2">2</mcreference> These youthful deities represented one of the earliest attested examples of the Indo-European Divine Twins motif among the Germanic peoples, serving as protectors and sacred guardians of their people. <mcreference link="https://tiwisko.wordpress.com/2014/11/27/the-alcis-the-divine-twins-among-the-germanic-peoples/" index="1">1</mcreference> Their worship took place in a sacred grove of "immemorial sanctity," where they were venerated as brothers and young men without any physical images or foreign influences. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahanarvali" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Etymology

- **Root meaning**: The name Alcis derives from Proto-Germanic *alhiz ~ *algiz, with two primary etymological interpretations <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alcis_(gods)" index="2">2</mcreference>
- **Language of origin**: Proto-Germanic, latinized by Roman sources
- **Variants and evolution**: 
  - Some scholars link it to *algiz meaning "elk" (Alces alces), making them elk-gods
  - Others connect it to *alh- meaning "sacred space" and "protection" (cf. Old English ealh, ealgian) <mcreference link="https://tiwisko.wordpress.com/2014/11/27/the-alcis-the-divine-twins-among-the-germanic-peoples/" index="1">1</mcreference>
- **Symbolic implications**: The name suggests either divine elk-shaped beings or protective deities of sacred spaces

> _"The name Alcis itself is of obscure etymology. Some link it to the word elk, while others (more insightfully IMO) link it to a group of words springing from the Proto-Indo-European *alk-, and the ideas of 'sacred space' and 'protection'"_

## Myths and Legends

**The Sacred Grove Ritual**  
The Alcis were worshipped in a grove of "immemorial sanctity" by the Nahanarvali. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahanarvali" index="1">1</mcreference> A priest dressed in female attire presided over their worship, and they were venerated as brothers and young men without any physical representations or foreign influences.

> _"Among these last is shown a grove of immemorial sanctity. A priest in female attire has the charge of it. But the deities are described in Roman language as Castor and Pollux. Such, indeed, are the attributes of the divinity, the name being Alcis. They have no images, or, indeed, any vestige of foreign superstition, but it is as brothers and as youths that the deities are worshipped."_  
> — Tacitus, Germania, Chapter 43 <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahanarvali" index="1">1</mcreference>

**Connection to Solar Mythology**  
Like other Indo-European Divine Twins, the Alcis were likely associated with the sun-goddess and may have been depicted pulling solar chariots across the sky. <mcreference link="https://tiwisko.wordpress.com/2014/11/27/the-alcis-the-divine-twins-among-the-germanic-peoples/" index="1">1</mcreference> Rock art from the Nordic Bronze Age shows paired figures associated with solar symbolism.

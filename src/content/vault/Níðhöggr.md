## Myths and Legends

**The World Tree's Tormentor**
Níðhöggr's primary mythological role is as the great dragon who endlessly gnaws at the roots of [[Yggdrasil]]. This constant assault threatens the stability of the nine worlds, as [[Yggdrasil]] serves as the cosmic axis holding all realms together.

**The Corpse-Eater of Náströnd**
In [[Náströnd]] ('Corpse Shore'), Níðhöggr feeds upon the bodies of those who have committed crimes against the moral fabric of Norse society: murderers, adulterers, and oath-breakers. This punishment continues through eternity, representing divine justice in the Norse afterlife.

**Role in Ragnarök**
During [[Ragnarök]], Níðhöggr survives the destruction of the world and continues to exist in the new world that emerges, carrying corpses in his wings, suggesting the cyclical nature of evil and punishment.

> _"Now Nidhogg will fly from below, dark dragon, flying from Nidafjöll; He carries corpses in his feathers as he flies, now he will sink."_
> — Völuspá, stanza 66

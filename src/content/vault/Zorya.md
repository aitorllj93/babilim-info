## Introduction
The Zorya (also known as Zorza, Zaria, or Zora) are celestial guardian deities in Slavic mythology who oversee the transitions between day and night. As daughters of the sun god [[Dazbog]], they serve as gatekeepers of their father's celestial palace, with Zorya Utrennyaya opening the gates at dawn and Zorya Vechernyaya closing them at dusk. Beyond their role as cosmic timekeepers, they stand as fierce protectors of the world, tasked with the crucial duty of keeping the doomsday hound [[Simargl]] chained to Polaris <mcreference link="https://www.slavorum.org/zorya-the-guardian-goddess-of-dusk-and-dawn/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Gates of Dazbog**
Each morning, Zorya Utrennyaya opens the golden gates of [[Dazbog]]'s palace, allowing her father to begin his daily journey across the sky in his sun chariot. As dusk approaches, Zorya Vechernyaya welcomes him back, closing the gates behind him as he returns to his celestial dwelling <mcreference link="https://slavic.mythologyworldwide.com/the-fascinating-world-of-zorya-the-dawn-and-dusk-goddesses/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Guardians of Simargl**
Perhaps their most crucial duty is the eternal vigil they keep over [[Simargl]], the doomsday hound chained to Polaris (the North Star). This divine beast, if ever freed from its celestial bonds, would devour the constellation Ursa Minor and bring about the end of the world. The Zorya sisters ensure these chains remain unbroken, preserving the cosmic order <mcreference link="https://brendan-noble.com/the-zorza-zorya-goddesses-of-dawn-and-dusk/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

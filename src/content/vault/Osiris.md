## Myths and Legends

**The Death and Resurrection**  
The central Osiris myth tells of his murder by his brother [[Set]], who dismembered his body into pieces. His wife [[Isis]] gathered the pieces and, through her magical powers, resurrected him long enough to conceive their son [[Horus]]. Osiris then became the first mummy and ruler of the afterlife <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Osiris/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Divine Judge**  
In the Hall of Two Truths, Osiris presides over the weighing of the heart ceremony, where the deceased's heart is weighed against the feather of Ma'at (truth). Those judged worthy join Osiris in eternal life <mcreference link="https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/osir/hd_osir.htm" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The First Pharaoh**  
As Egypt's first divine king, Osiris established civilization, teaching agriculture and proper worship of the gods. His death and resurrection established the pattern for royal succession, with each pharaoh becoming Osiris upon death while their heir became the living [[Horus]].

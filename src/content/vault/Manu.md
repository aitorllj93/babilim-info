## Myths and Legends

**The Great Flood**
The most significant myth associated with Manu (specifically Vaivasvata Manu) parallels other global flood myths. According to the Shatapatha Brahmana, he was warned by a fish (later revealed to be Vishnu's Matsya avatar) about an impending flood. Following the fish's advice, he built a boat that carried him, the seven sages (Saptarishi), and seeds of all living things. When the flood came, the fish guided his boat to safety by towing it to a mountain peak.

**Creation of New Humanity**
After the flood receded, Manu performed a sacrifice by pouring oblations of butter and sour milk into the waters. After a year, a woman emerged who called herself Manu's daughter. Together, they became the progenitors of a new human race.

## Myths and Legends

**The Tale of Atargatis and the Shepherd**
According to legend, Atargatis fell in love with a mortal shepherd and accidentally caused his death. Overcome with shame, she cast herself into a lake near Ascalon. The waters could not conceal her divine beauty, and she was transformed into a mermaid form – human above the waist and fish below. This myth explains her association with fish and water.

**The Birth of Semiramis**
Another tale recounts how Atargatis bore a daughter named [[Semiramis]], who became the legendary queen of Assyria. After abandoning her child, Atargatis was transformed into a fish-goddess, while her daughter was raised by doves, explaining why both fish and doves became sacred to her cult.

## Introduction

The Rozhanitsy ("birth attendants") were among the most revered and feared deities in the pre-Christian religion of the Slavs. These invisible spirits or goddesses of fate held dominion over pregnancy, motherhood, marriage, and the destinies of all mortals. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference> Usually manifesting as three sisters—though sometimes as many as nine—they were intimately connected with [[Rod]], the primordial deity of creation and ancestry. <mcreference link="https://oldworldgods.com/slavic/rozhanitsy/" index="2">2</mcreference> Their worship persisted well into the Christian era, testament to their profound importance in Slavic spiritual life.

## Myths and Legends

**The Three-Day Visitation**
The most fundamental myth describes how the Rozhanitsy would appear at midnight, three days after a child's birth, standing at the infant's cradle to determine their fate for life. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference> The three sisters each had a role: the youngest would spin the thread of life, the second would measure its length, and the eldest would cut it—determining how long the child would live.

> *"After determining the fate of the child, it was saved as an indelible mark on the forehead. The rozhanitsy's opinions on the future of the child were often contradictory, and the final, oldest parent makes the final decision."* <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>

**The Epic of Prince Marko**
In South Slavic epic poetry, the Narecnitsy appear to determine the fate of heroes. The epic describes their midnight arrival to proclaim destiny upon the newborn. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>

**Other Myths**
- The Protection of Pregnant Women – They were said to watch over expectant mothers throughout pregnancy
- The Weaving of [[Dola]] – They assigned each person their unique combination of talents and characteristics
- The Creation of [[Nedolya]] – When displeased, they could weave misfortune instead of blessing

## Worship and Rituals

- **Forms of worship**: Offerings of bread, honey, cheese, and grains; animal sacrifices; libations
- **Festivals**: Celebrated on December 26th (later replaced by Christian Feast of the Mother of God) <mcreference link="https://oldworldgods.com/slavic/rozhanitsy/" index="2">2</mcreference>
- **Sacred spaces**: Household altars, birthing chambers, sacred groves
- **Archaeological remains**: References in 11th-16th century Christian texts condemning their worship

The 11th-century *Word of St. Gregory the Theologian* provides the earliest documented evidence: "Also, this word reached the Slavs, and they began to offer sacrifices to [[Rod]] and the Rozhanitsy before [[Perun]], their god." <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Later Influence

- **Syncretism**: Compared to Greek [[Moirai]] (Clotho, Lachesis, Atropos), Roman [[Parcae]], Germanic [[Norns]]
- **Legacy in later religions**: Replaced by the Mother of God and female saints (Parascheva, Anastasia, Barbara) after Christianization <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>
- **Presence in modern culture**: Continue to appear in Slavic folklore, literature, and neo-pagan practices

## Modern Interpretations

- **Psychological/archetypal readings**: Represent the archetypal triple goddess (maiden, mother, crone) and the human need to understand fate and destiny
- **Comparative mythology**: Part of the widespread Indo-European tradition of fate goddesses who spin, measure, and cut the thread of life
- **Recent academic theories**: Boris Rybakov linked Rozhanitsa with [[Lada]], claiming she was [[Rod]]'s partner and the first rozhanitsa <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deities_and_fairies_of_fate_in_Slavic_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>

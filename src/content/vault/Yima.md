## Myths and Legends

**The Golden Age**  
According to the Avesta, Ahura Mazda offered Yima the role of bringing his religion to mankind, but Yima declined, choosing instead to be a protector and nourisher of the world. Under his rule, neither hot nor cold existed, and there was neither death nor aging. The earth had to be expanded thrice to accommodate the growing population and prosperity <mcreference link="https://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/yima" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Vara**  
When Ahura Mazda forewarned Yima about a devastating winter that would destroy all life, he instructed Yima to build an underground shelter (vara) and gather the finest specimens of plants, animals, and humans to preserve them. This vara became a paradise where life continued undisturbed by the catastrophic winter outside.

**The Fall from Grace**  
Despite his glorious reign, Yima eventually fell from grace when he began to take pride in his achievements and lied to his people. The divine glory (xvarenah) departed from him in the form of a bird, and he lost his immortality and kingdom <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Jamshid/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

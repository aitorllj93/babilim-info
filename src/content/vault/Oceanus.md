## Introduction

Oceanus was one of the most ancient and primordial deities in Greek mythology, a Titan who personified the great river that the Greeks believed encircled the entire world <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus" index="1">1</mcreference>. As the eldest son of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), he embodied all seas and oceans, serving as the source of all rivers, lakes, springs, and wells <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/oceanus" index="2">2</mcreference>. Unlike the more turbulent Olympian gods, Oceanus was renowned for his peaceful and benevolent nature, standing apart from the violent conflicts that characterized much of ancient mythology <mcreference link="https://www.centreofexcellence.com/oceanus-in-greek-mythology/" index="4">4</mcreference>.

## Etymology

- **Root meaning**: The name "Oceanus" (Greek Ὠκεανός, Ōkeanos) is identical to the Greek word ōkeanos, meaning "great sea or river" <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/oceanus" index="2">2</mcreference>
- **Language of origin**: The etymology is described as "obscure" and "cannot be explained from Greek" according to M. L. West <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus" index="1">1</mcreference>
- **Variants and evolution**: Pherecydes of Syros used the form Ōgenós (Ὠγενός), lending support for the name being a loanword <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanus" index="1">1</mcreference>
- **Symbolic implications**: Several theories exist for its origin - a Semitic derivation, a loanword from the Aegean Pre-Greek substrate, or possible Indo-European connections from Proto-Indo-European *ō-kei-m̥[h₁]no-, meaning "lying on" <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/oceanus" index="2">2</mcreference>

## Myths and Legends

**Neutrality in the Titanomachy**  
Unlike his fellow Titans, Oceanus chose not to participate in the great war between the Titans and Olympians. While his brothers fought fiercely against Zeus, Oceanus maintained neutrality, reflecting his peaceful nature and wisdom. This decision saved him from being cast into Tartarus with the other defeated Titans <mcreference link="https://www.centreofexcellence.com/oceanus-in-greek-mythology/" index="4">4</mcreference>.

**Foster Father to Hera**  
Together with his wife [[Tethys]], Oceanus raised and sheltered Hera during the Titanomachy, demonstrating his role as a protector and nurturer of the next generation of gods <mcreference link="https://www.centreofexcellence.com/oceanus-in-greek-mythology/" index="4">4</mcreference>.

> _"Oceanus, from whom the gods are sprung, and mother Tethys"_  
> — Homer, Iliad

**Other Myths**  
- The Golden Cup of Helios – Heracles borrowed Oceanus's golden cup to sail to Erytheia
- Primordial Creation – Some traditions suggest Oceanus and Tethys were the original divine parents
- The River's Path – His waters were thought to flow endlessly back into themselves, forming a perfect circle

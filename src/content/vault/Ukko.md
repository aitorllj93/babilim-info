##  Introduction
Ukko was the supreme deity of Finnish mythology, revered as the god of sky, thunder, weather, and harvest. His name, meaning "old man" or "grandfather," reflects his patriarchal status in the Finnish pantheon, where he was often referred to as Ylijumala (Supreme God). His thunderbolts and weather powers made him essential to agricultural societies that depended on rainfall for their crops.

## Myths and Legends

**The Thunder God's Marriage**
According to folklore, thunderstorms were sometimes interpreted as Ukko copulating with his wife [[Akka]] ("old woman"), though some scholars like Martti Haavio have disputed this interpretation.

**The Celestial Smith**
When Ukko assumed the position of supreme sky god, he may have displaced the earlier deity [[Ilmarinen]], who then became reimagined as a mortal smith-hero in Finnish mythology. Some stories tell of Ilmarinen vaulting the sky-dome, suggesting his original celestial nature.

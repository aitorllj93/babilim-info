## Myths and Legends

**Main Characteristics**

Mari dwells primarily in mountain caves, particularly the eastern slope of Mount Anboto. She is known to travel between different mountain peaks, appearing as a ball of fire or riding across the sky, often accompanied by storms. Her movements are said to influence weather patterns - when she's present in Anboto, it rains; when she's elsewhere, the weather is dry.

**The Story of Kattalin**

A notable legend tells of a shepherdess named Kattalin who lost one of her sheep near Mari's cave. Upon finding both the sheep and Mari, she was offered wealth in exchange for seven years of service. Kattalin accepted and learned various magical arts from Mari, including understanding animal language and plant magic. At the end of her service, Mari rewarded her with what appeared to be a lump of coal that turned to gold upon leaving the cave.

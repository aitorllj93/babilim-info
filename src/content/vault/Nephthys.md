## Myths and Legends

**The Osiris Myth**  
Nephthys plays a crucial role in the myth of Osiris. Disguised as her sister Isis, she became mother to Anubis through Osiris. Later, when Set murdered Osiris, Nephthys abandoned her husband Set to help Isis gather the pieces of Osiris's body, demonstrating her loyalty to cosmic order over marital ties <mcreference link="https://egyptian-history.com/blogs/egyptian-gods/goddess-nephthys" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Protection of the Dead**  
As a funerary goddess, Nephthys worked alongside Isis to protect the dead, particularly the canopic jars containing the preserved organs. Professional mourners at Egyptian funerals were known as "Hawks of Nephthys," embodying her role in the transition between life and death <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Nephthys/" index="4">4</mcreference>.

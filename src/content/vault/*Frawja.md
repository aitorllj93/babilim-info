## Historical Development

The evolution of *Frawja into later Germanic deities represents a complex theological development. The term began as an honorific title for men of high social standing before becoming deified in various forms across Germanic cultures.

Linguistic evidence shows that *Frawja was primarily a title meaning 'lord' or 'master', which eventually became personified as a divine figure. This process of deification led to the emergence of various god figures in different Germanic cultures, most notably:

- [[Freyr]] in Norse mythology
- Related to the feminine counterpart [[*Frawjōn]]

## Divine Family

*Frawja's divine relationships became more defined as the figure evolved into specific deities across Germanic cultures. In Norse mythology, where the figure became most prominent as [[Freyr]], the divine family structure included:

- Father: [[Njörðr]]
- Sister: [[Freyja]]

These relationships reflect later developments in Norse mythology rather than original Proto-Germanic beliefs.

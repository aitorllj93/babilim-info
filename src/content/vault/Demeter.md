## Myths and Legends

**The Abduction of Persephone**  
The central myth of Demeter revolves around the loss of her daughter [[Persephone]], who was abducted by [[Hades]]. In her grief, Demeter wandered the earth, causing all vegetation to wither. Only when [[Zeus]] negotiated Persephone's partial return was the cycle of seasons established <mcreference link="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Demeter" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Gift of Agriculture**  
During her wanderings, Demeter stopped at Eleusis, where she was kindly received. In gratitude, she taught [[Triptolemus]] the arts of agriculture, sending him forth in a dragon-drawn chariot to spread this knowledge throughout the world <mcreference link="https://www.ducksters.com/history/ancient_greece/demeter.php" index="5">5</mcreference>.

**The Eleusinian Mysteries**  
At Eleusis, Demeter established her most sacred cult, the Eleusinian Mysteries, which promised initiates a blessed afterlife. These mysteries, predating the Olympian pantheon, became one of the most important religious traditions in the ancient world.

## Myths and Legends

**The Purification of Apollo**
After [[Apollo]] slew the serpent [[Python]] at Delphi, he required ritual purification to cleanse himself of the miasma (pollution) of the kill. Karmanor performed these crucial rites in Crete, allowing Apollo to fully assume his oracular and prophetic powers <mcreference link="https://www.theoi.com/Cult/ApollonCult.html" index="1">1</mcreference>.

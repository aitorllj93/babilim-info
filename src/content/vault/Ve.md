## Myths and Legends

**The Creation of the World**  
After the slaying of [[Ymir]], Ve worked with his brothers [[Odin]] and [[Vili]] to create the cosmos from the primordial giant's body. From Ymir's flesh they made the earth, from his blood the seas, from his bones the mountains, and from his skull the dome of the sky.

**The Creation of Humans**  
In one of the most significant acts of creation, Ve and his brothers discovered two trees on the seashore - [[Ask]] and [[Embla]]. Together, they transformed these trees into the first humans. Ve's specific contribution was to give them speech and appearance, while [[Odin]] provided breath and spirit, and [[Vili]] gave them consciousness and movement.

**The Sacred Trinity**  
Ve formed part of a divine trinity with his brothers, each representing different aspects of creation and consciousness. While [[Odin]] embodied inspiration and spirit, and [[Vili]] represented will and thought, Ve manifested the power of sanctity and form.

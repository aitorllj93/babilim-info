## Myths and Legends

**The Great Imprisonment**  
The central myth involves Aži Dahāka's defeat by the hero [[Θraētaona]], who could not kill the demon but managed to chain him beneath Mount Damāvand. There he remains imprisoned until the end of time <mcreference link="https://allaboutdragons.com/dragons/Azhi_Dahaka" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The Final Battle**  
According to prophecy, Aži Dahāka will break free during the final days, consuming one-third of humanity before being ultimately slain by the hero Kərəsāspa, marking a crucial moment in the final triumph of good over evil.

**Divine Rejection**  
In the Avesta, Aži Dahāka sought power from the yazatas (divine beings) Arədvī Sūrā and Vayu to depopulate the world, but being representatives of good, they refused his request.

## Cultural Significance

**Cosmic Evil**  
As a creation of [[Ahriman]], Aži Dahāka represents the ultimate manifestation of evil in Zoroastrian dualism.

**Apocalyptic Role**  
His prophesied release and final defeat form a crucial part of Zoroastrian eschatology.

**Symbol of Tyranny**  
In later traditions, particularly in the Shahnameh, Aži Dahāka became a symbol of unjust and demonic rulership.

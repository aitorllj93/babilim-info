## Introduction

Crius (Ancient Greek: Κρεῖος or Κριός), also known as Kreios or Krios, was one of the twelve primordial Titans in Greek mythology. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crius" index="3">3</mcreference> Born from the union of Uranus (Sky) and Gaia (Earth), he served as the Pillar of the South, one of the four cosmic supports that held the heavens separate from the earth. <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Crius/crius.html" index="2">2</mcreference> Though often overshadowed by his more prominent siblings like Cronus and Oceanus, Crius played a crucial genealogical role as the father of powerful deities associated with destruction, war, and celestial phenomena. <mcreference link="https://olympioi.com/greek-gods/crius" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Etymology

- **Root meaning** of the name: The name "Crius" or "Krios" derives from the ancient Greek word meaning "ram" (κριός), linking him to the constellation Aries. <mcreference link="https://olympioi.com/greek-gods/crius" index="1">1</mcreference>
- **Language of origin**: Ancient Greek
- **Variants and evolution**: Known by several forms including Kreios and Krios, with the name remaining unchanged even in Roman mythology—a rarity among Greek deities. <mcreference link="https://olympioi.com/greek-gods/crius" index="1">1</mcreference>
- **Symbolic or metaphoric implications**: The ram symbolism connects to leadership, strength, and the celestial sphere, particularly the constellation Aries which marked the beginning of the new year in ancient Greek calendars. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crius" index="3">3</mcreference>

> _"Although 'krios' was also the ancient Greek word for 'ram', the Titan's chthonic position in the underworld means no classical association with Aries, the ram of the zodiac, is ordinarily made."_

## Myths and Legends

**The Castration of Uranus**  
Crius played a crucial role in the cosmic rebellion against his father Uranus. Along with his brothers [[Iapetus]], [[Coeus]], and [[Hyperion]], he served as one of the four pillars holding their father in place while [[Cronus]] castrated him with a sickle provided by their mother [[Gaia]]. <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Crius/crius.html" index="2">2</mcreference> As the Pillar of the South, Crius held his position at the southern corner of the earth during this pivotal moment that would reshape the cosmic order.

**The Titanomachy**  
During the ten-year war between the Titans and the Olympians, Crius fought alongside his fellow Titans, though he did not play a specific prominent role in the conflict. <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Crius/crius.html" index="2">2</mcreference> When the Titans were defeated by [[Zeus]] and the Olympians, Crius was cast into Tartarus, the deepest level of the underworld, along with most of his siblings.

**Other Myths**  
- The establishment of cosmic order – Crius helped maintain the separation between heaven and earth
- The genealogical foundation – His union with [[Eurybia]] produced the next generation of powerful deities

## Worship and Rituals

- **Forms of worship**: Limited evidence of direct worship; primarily honored through genealogical traditions
- **Festivals**: No specific festivals recorded, though his descendants were widely venerated
- **Sacred spaces**: No dedicated temples known, as he was more of a cosmic principle than an actively worshipped deity
- **Archaeological remains**: Mentions in Hesiod's Theogony and other ancient texts serve as primary sources

---

## Later Influence

- **Syncretism**: Retained his name in Roman mythology without change
- **Legacy in later religions**: His descendants, particularly [[Hecate]], became significant in later magical and religious traditions
- **Presence in modern literature and culture**: Appears in modern retellings of Greek mythology and fantasy literature

## Modern Interpretations

- **Psychological/archetypal readings**: Represents the foundational, stabilizing force in the psyche—the reliable structures that support consciousness
- **Comparative mythology**: Similar to other cosmic pillar deities found in various world mythologies
- **Recent academic theories or discoveries**: Modern scholars like M.L. West suggest Crius was added by Hesiod primarily to provide genealogical context for more important figures like [[Hecate]]. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crius" index="3">3</mcreference>

##  Introduction

Damia (Ancient Greek: Δαμια) was a revered goddess in ancient Greek religion, embodying the fertile earth and seasonal renewal <mcreference link="https://mythus.fandom.com/wiki/Damia" index="1">1</mcreference>. As one of the Horae (Seasons), she held dominion over the earth's fertility and agricultural abundance, often worshipped alongside her divine companion [[Auxesia]] <mcreference link="https://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/HoraDamia.html" index="2">2</mcreference>. Her cult was particularly significant in the regions of Attica and Argolis, where she was venerated as both an independent deity and as an epithet of the great goddess [[Demeter]] <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demeter" index="3">3</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Epidaurian Famine**  
When the people of Epidaurus suffered from severe drought and famine, they consulted the oracle at Delphi. The Pythia instructed them to create wooden images of Damia and [[Auxesia]] from sacred Athenian olive wood. Once these statues were erected, their land flourished and brought forth abundant fruit, ending the famine <mcreference link="https://mythus.fandom.com/wiki/Damia" index="1">1</mcreference>.

> _"The men of Epidaurus asked the Athenians to permit them to cut down some olive trees, supposing the olives there to be the holiest"_  
> — Herodotus, Histories 5.82

**The Theft by Aegina**  
The Aeginetans, in rebellion against Epidaurus, stole the sacred statues of Damia and Auxesia. When Athenians attempted to retrieve them, they were struck by earthquake and madness, with only one survivor returning. The statues were said to have fallen to their knees during this attempted theft and remained in that posture thereafter <mcreference link="https://mythus.fandom.com/wiki/Damia" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Cretan Maidens**  
According to Troezenian legend, Damia and Auxesia were originally Cretan maidens, possibly priestesses, who were wrongfully stoned to death during a local insurrection. They were subsequently elevated to divine status and honored with the festival of Lithobolia ("Stoning") <mcreference link="https://mythus.fandom.com/wiki/Damia" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Birth of Adonis**
Born from Myrrha (or Smyrna), who was transformed into a myrrh tree after being cursed with an unnatural love for her father. The tree split open, giving birth to the beautiful infant Adonis.

**The Love of Aphrodite**
Aphrodite, enchanted by his beauty, entrusted the infant Adonis to Persephone. Both goddesses fell in love with him, leading to a dispute that Zeus had to settle by dividing Adonis's time between them and himself.

**Death and Resurrection**
Adonis was killed by a wild boar (either sent by Artemis or Ares in jealousy). From his blood sprung the anemone flower. His death and return became symbolic of the seasonal cycle.

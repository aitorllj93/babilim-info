## Myths and Legends

**The Well of Fate**  
At the foot of Yggdrasil, Urðr and her sisters tend to Urðarbrunnr (the Well of Urðr), from which they draw water to nourish the world tree. Each day, they take water and mix it with the sacred mud around the well to create a paste that prevents Yggdrasil's branches from rotting <mcreference link="https://norsespirit.com/blogs/mythology/the-norns" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Weaving of Fate**  
Urðr, along with her sisters, weaves the threads of destiny for all beings in the cosmos. Their decisions are final and binding, affecting even the gods themselves. When a child is born, Urðr and her sisters appear to determine their fate, weaving their future into the grand tapestry of existence <mcreference link="https://mythologyworldwide.com/norns-the-fates-of-norse-mythology/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

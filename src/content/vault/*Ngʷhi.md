## Myths and Legends

**The Dragon-Slaying Myth**  
In the foundational Proto-Indo-European myth, *H₂n̥gʷʰis steals cattle or hoards the waters in its mountain lair. The hero *Trito, empowered by an intoxicating drink and aided by the storm god *Perkʷunos, confronts and slays the serpent, releasing the waters or recovering the cattle, thus establishing cosmic order.

**Cultural Variations**  
- Vedic: Indra slays Vṛtra (also called Ahi) to release the waters
- Norse: Thor battles Jörmungandr
- Germanic: Beowulf vs Dragon
- Iranian: Θraētaona defeats Aži Dahāka
- Hittite: Tarhunna battles Illuyanka
- Greek: Apollo slays Python, Zeus defeats Typhon

## Relationship with Other Deities

- Primary adversary of [[*Perkʷunos]]
- Opposition to [[*Dyḗus]] and divine order
- Associated with cosmic waters and chaos

## Legacy in Different Traditions

**Indo-Iranian**  
In Vedic tradition, the serpent appears as Vṛtra, called Ahi, whom Indra must slay to release the cosmic waters. In Iranian mythology, the three-headed dragon Aži Dahāka represents cosmic evil.

**Anatolian**  
The Hittite Illuyanka, whose name may combine two words for "serpent," battles the storm god Tarhunna in a similar narrative pattern.

**European**  
The motif persists in various forms: the Greek Python and Typhon, the Norse Jörmungandr, and the Slavic Zmey, all reflecting aspects of the original *H₂n̥gʷʰis myth.

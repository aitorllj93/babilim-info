## Myths and Legends

**The Separation of Sky and Earth**  
The most famous myth tells of Nut's passionate love for the earth god Geb. Their eternal embrace prevented the creation of the world until Ra ordered their father Shu to separate them. Shu lifted Nut high above, creating the space where life could exist. This separation is depicted in countless Egyptian artworks <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Nut/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Curse of Ra**  
Ra cursed Nut, declaring she could not give birth on any day of the 360-day calendar. Thoth gambled with the moon god Khonsu, winning five extra days during which Nut could give birth to her five children: Osiris, Isis, Set, Nephthys, and Horus the Elder <mcreference link="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Nut-Egyptian-goddess" index="2">2</mcreference>.

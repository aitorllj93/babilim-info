## Myths and Legends

**The Year King**  
As a vegetation deity, Velchanos embodied the cycle of death and rebirth in nature. Each year, he would die with the withering of vegetation and be reborn with the spring growth, a pattern that later influenced the myths of Zeus's birth and death on Crete.

**The Sacred Cave**  
Velchanos was associated with the sacred cave on Mount Dikte, which later became known as the birthplace of Zeus. This connection contributed to their eventual syncretism and the evolution of Zeus Velchanos.

- His role in agricultural rituals

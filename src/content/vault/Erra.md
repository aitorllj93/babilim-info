## Myths and Legends

**The Epic of Erra**
The primary myth featuring Erra tells of his devastating rampage across Mesopotamia. After being convinced by the demon [[Ishum]] to rise from inactivity, Erra becomes consumed with destructive fury. He convinces [[Marduk]] to temporarily abandon his post guarding the cosmic order, leading to chaos and devastation. Cities are destroyed, social order collapses, and brother turns against brother until Ishum finally convinces Erra to cease his destruction.

**Key themes in the Epic include**:
- The danger of unchecked divine power
- The relationship between order and chaos
- The role of divine counselors (Ishum)
- The fragility of civilization

**The Seven Warriors**
Erra commands seven warrior gods known as the Sebitti, who assist him in bringing destruction and chaos. They are described as without mercy or distinction, destroying both the righteous and wicked alike.

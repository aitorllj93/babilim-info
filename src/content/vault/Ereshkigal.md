## Myths and Legends

**The Descent of Inanna**  
In this pivotal myth, [[Inanna]] attempts to extend her power into the underworld by attending the funeral of Gugalanna, Ereshkigal's husband. As Inanna passes through each of the seven gates, she is stripped of her divine powers. Upon reaching Ereshkigal's throne room, she is judged, killed, and hung on a hook. Her eventual resurrection comes only through divine intervention and the sacrifice of [[Dumuzi]].

**Marriage to Nergal**  
In the Akkadian myth, [[Nergal]] offends Ereshkigal by not showing proper respect. After a confrontation, they eventually become consorts, uniting the powers of death and war in the underworld.

**The Death of Gugalanna**  
Though less well-preserved, myths speak of her first husband Gugalanna (the Bull of Heaven) whose death becomes the catalyst for [[Inanna]]'s descent.

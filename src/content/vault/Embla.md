## Myths and Legends

**The Creation of Humanity**  
According to the Poetic Edda, specifically in Völuspá, Embla was created when three gods ([[Odin]], [[Hœnir]], and [[Lóðurr]]) found two trees by the seashore. They transformed these trees into the first humans, with Embla being crafted from an elm tree. The gods bestowed upon her and [[Ask]] the gifts of life, consciousness, and physical form.

> "Spirit they possessed not, sense they had not,
Blood nor motive powers, nor goodly color;
Spirit gave Odin, sense gave Hœnir,
Blood gave Lóðurr, and goodly color."
> — Völuspá, stanza 18

In the Prose Edda version, it was [[Odin]], [[Vili]], and [[Ve]] who created Embla and [[Ask]], granting them different attributes: spirit and life, consciousness and movement, and form, speech, hearing, and sight respectively.

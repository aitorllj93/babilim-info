## Myths and Legends

**The Two Stars That Were One**
The Ancient Greeks initially believed that Hesperus (the Evening Star) and [[Phosphorus]] (the Morning Star) were two different celestial bodies. Later, following Babylonian astronomical knowledge, they discovered that both were actually the same celestial body - the planet Venus. This revelation led to the understanding that Hesperus and [[Phosphorus]] were two aspects of the same divine entity <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperus" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Love of Hymenaeus**
According to some accounts, Hesperus dwelled on Mount Oeta in Thessaly, where he fell in love with the young [[Hymenaeus]], son of [[Dionysus]] and [[Ariadne]] <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hesperus" index="2">2</mcreference>.

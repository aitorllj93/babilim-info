## Introduction
Melqart was the tutelary deity of the Phoenician city of Tyre, whose worship spread throughout the Mediterranean as Phoenician traders established colonies from Carthage to Spain. His name, meaning "King of the City," reflects his role as divine protector of Tyre and its maritime empire. As the Phoenicians' influence grew, Melqart became one of the most widely venerated deities of the ancient Mediterranean world, later becoming identified with the Greek [[Heracles]].

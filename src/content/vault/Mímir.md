## Myths and Legends

**The Well of Wisdom**
Mímir's most significant myth revolves around his well, located beneath one of [[Yggdrasil]]'s three roots. This well contained all the wisdom and memory of the cosmos. When [[Odin]] came seeking knowledge, Mímir demanded the sacrifice of an eye as payment for a drink from the well, a price Odin willingly paid.

**The Æsir-Vanir Hostage Exchange**
During the peace negotiations between the [[Aesir]] and [[Vanir]], Mímir was sent as a hostage to the Vanir along with [[Hœnir]]. When the Vanir discovered that Hœnir could only make decisions with Mímir's counsel, they felt cheated and decapitated Mímir, sending his head back to Odin.

**The Speaking Head**
Odin preserved Mímir's severed head with herbs and magic, allowing it to continue sharing wisdom and prophecy. The head became one of Odin's most valued counselors, especially in times of great need.

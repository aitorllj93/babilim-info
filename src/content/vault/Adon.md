## Introduction
Adon (אָדוֹן) was a Phoenician and Hebrew title meaning "lord" or "master" that evolved into both a divine epithet and a deified figure in ancient Near Eastern religions. This term became particularly significant in the worship of [[Tammuz]] and in the Greek adaptation of the dying-and-rising god [[Adonis]].

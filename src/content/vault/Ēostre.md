##  Introduction
Ēostre (also known as Eostre or Ostara) was the Germanic goddess of dawn, spring, and renewal, whose worship was so significant that it influenced the naming of the Christian festival of Easter. While direct historical sources about her are limited, she represents a significant figure in Germanic paganism and stands as the Germanic cognate of the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess [[*H₂éwsōs]].

## Myths and Legends

**Historical Record**  
Our primary historical reference to Ēostre comes from the Venerable Bede's 8th-century work "De temporum ratione," where he mentions that the paschal month was once called "Ēosturmōnaþ" after the goddess Ēostre, during which feasts were held in her honor.

**Spring Renewal**  
While specific myths haven't survived, the traditions associated with her suggest she was celebrated as a goddess of spring renewal and dawn, marking the return of warmth and light after winter.

**Modern Theories**  
Scholars suggest her worship involved celebrations of spring, fertility rites, and possibly sacred hares and eggs, though many of these connections are debated in academic circles.

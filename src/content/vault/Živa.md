##  Introduction

Živa (also known as Zhiva, Siwa) stands as one of the most vital figures in Slavic mythology, embodying the very essence of life itself. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDiva_(mythology)" index="2">2</mcreference> This mother goddess was revered particularly among the Polabian Slavs of the Obodritic confederation, where she served as a divine protector of fertility, vitality, and the life-giving forces of nature. <mcreference link="https://oldworldgods.com/slavic/zhiva-goddess/" index="1">1</mcreference> Her worship represents the Slavic understanding of the sacred feminine as the source of all creation and renewal.

## Myths and Legends

**The Goddess of Ratzeburg**  
According to Helmold's Chronicle, Živa held a position of supreme importance among the Polabian tribes, with her main cult center possibly located at Ratzeburg. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDiva_(mythology)" index="2">2</mcreference> She was venerated alongside other major Slavic deities like Prone and Redigast, forming a triad of the most important gods in the region.

> _"In those days, the multifarious worship of idols and the error of superstition were fortified throughout Slavia. For apart from the sacred forests and the household deities, which abounded in the country and the cities, the most important and preeminent gods were Prone, god of Oldenburg country, Siwa, goddess of the Polabians, and Redigast, god of Obotrite country."_  
> — Helmold of Bozov, Chronicle of the Slavs

**Connection to [[Mokosh]]**  
Some scholars, including Vyacheslav Ivanov and Vladimir Toporov, consider Živa to be an epithet of the great earth goddess [[Mokosh]], suggesting she represents a specific aspect of the universal mother deity. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%BDiva_(mythology)" index="2">2</mcreference>

**Seasonal Cycle with [[Morana]]**  
In broader Slavic mythology, goddesses associated with life (like Živa/Vesna) were understood in opposition to death goddesses like [[Morana]], creating the eternal cycle of seasonal change. <mcreference link="https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends/morana-vesna-006984" index="5">5</mcreference>

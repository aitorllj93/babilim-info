## Myths and Legends

**The Famine of Epidaurus**  
When Epidaurus was struck by a devastating famine, the Delphic Oracle advised the people to create statues of Auxesia and [[Damia]] from olive wood. <mcreference link="https://www.theoi.com/Ouranios/HoraAuxesia.html" index="1">1</mcreference> The Epidaurians requested olive wood from Athens, which was granted on condition of annual sacrifices to [[Athena]] Agraulos and [[Erechtheus]]. Once the statues were erected, the land became fertile again.

> _"For this reason they inquired at Delphi concerning this calamity, and the priestess bade them set up images of Damia and Auxesia, saying that if they so did their luck would be better"_  
> — Herodotus, Histories

**The Theft of the Sacred Statues**  
When Aegina separated from Epidaurus around 540 BCE, the Aeginetans stole the sacred statues of Auxesia and [[Damia]], establishing them on their island. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxesia_(Greek_mythology)" index="2">2</mcreference> When Athenians attempted to reclaim the statues by force, divine intervention struck them with madness, thunder, and earthquakes, causing them to kill each other. Only one Athenian survived to tell the tale.

**The Cretan Maidens**  
According to Troezenian legend, Auxesia and [[Damia]] were originally Cretan maidens (possibly priestesses) who were wrongfully stoned to death during a civil insurrection. <mcreference link="https://pantheon.org/articles/a/auxesia.html" index="3">3</mcreference> The Troezenians later honored them as goddesses and established the festival of Lithobolia (stone-throwing) to commemorate their martyrdom.

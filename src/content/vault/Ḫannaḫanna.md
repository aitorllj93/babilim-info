## Myths and Legends

**The Myth of Telepinu**
One of the most significant myths involving Ḫannaḫanna concerns the disappearance of the god Telepinu. When Telepinu vanished, his father, the Storm-god Tarhunna, sought Ḫannaḫanna's help. She devised a plan and sent a bee to locate Telepinu. The bee succeeded in finding him and restored his vitality by stinging his hands and feet and wiping his eyes and feet with wax <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ḫannaḫanna" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Disappearance of Ḫannaḫanna**
In another significant myth, Ḫannaḫanna herself disappears in a fit of anger. Her absence causes chaos in the world: cattle and sheep suffocate, and mothers (both human and animal) neglect their children. Order is only restored when her anger is banished to the Dark Earth or through a ritual involving burning brushwood and allowing the vapor to enter her body <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ḫannaḫanna" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Missing Inara**
When the goddess Inara went missing, Ḫannaḫanna was informed by the Storm-god's bee and initiated a search with her female attendant <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ḫannaḫanna" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Cultural Impact

Ḫannaḫanna's dual nature as both nurturing grandmother and temperamental deity reflects the Hittite understanding of divine power.

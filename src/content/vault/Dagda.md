## Myths and Legends

**The Mórrígan's Meeting**  
One of the most significant myths involves his encounter with [[Morrigan]] at Samhain. She straddles a river while he helps her, and they become lovers. She then aids the Tuatha Dé Danann in battle, foretelling the futures of all who would die.

**The Magical Club**  
The Dagda possessed a massive club that required eight men to lift. One end could kill the living while the other could restore life to the dead. He would drag it behind him, leaving a track as deep as a territorial boundary.

**The Cauldron of Plenty**  
His cauldron, called the Coire Ansic, was said to leave no company unsatisfied, providing endless food and reflecting each person's true merit in the portion they received.

**The Time-Controlling Harp**  
His magical harp, Uaithne, could order the seasons and control men's emotions. When stolen by the Fomorians, he recovered it in a famous quest, demonstrating his might.

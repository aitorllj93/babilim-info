## Myths and Legends

**Creation by Atum**
In the Heliopolitan creation myth, Tefnut was created along with her twin brother Shu through Atum's act of parthenogenesis. In one version, she emerged from Atum's sneeze, while in another, she was spat out like saliva <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tefnut" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Flight to Nubia**
One significant myth tells of Tefnut's rage and escape to Nubia, causing drought and chaos in Egypt. Only after receiving the title "honorable" from Thoth did she return, restoring moisture and fertility to the land <mcreference link="https://historycooperative.org/tefnut-goddess-of-moisture-and-rain/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Titanomachy and Eternal Punishment**  
Atlas led the Titan rebellion against Zeus during the Titanomachy <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html" index="3">3</mcreference>. When the Titans were defeated, while many were confined to Tartarus, Zeus condemned Atlas to a unique punishment: to stand at the western edge of the earth and hold up the sky on his shoulders for eternity <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)" index="1">1</mcreference>.

> *"Atlas through hard constraint upholds the wide heaven with unwearying head and arms, standing at the borders of the earth before the clear-voiced Hesperides"* <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/atlas" index="5">5</mcreference>  
> — Hesiod, Theogony

**The Labor of [[Heracles]]**  
During [[Heracles]]' eleventh labor, Atlas agreed to fetch the golden apples from his daughters, the [[Hesperides]], while [[Heracles]] temporarily held the celestial sphere <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Atlas/atlas.html" index="3">3</mcreference>. Atlas attempted to trick [[Heracles]] into permanently taking his burden, but the hero outwitted the Titan and reclaimed the apples.

**Encounter with [[Perseus]]**  
[[Perseus]], seeking hospitality, was refused by Atlas who feared a prophecy about a son of Zeus stealing his golden apples <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_(mythology)" index="1">1</mcreference>. In revenge, [[Perseus]] showed Atlas the head of [[Medusa]], turning the Titan into the stone mountains that bear his name.

## Myths and Legends

**The Maiming of Ailill**
One of the most significant myths involving Áine tells of her encounter with Ailill Aulom, the King of Munster. When the king tried to rape her at Knockainey on Samhain Eve, Áine defended herself by biting off his ear. This act rendered him unfit to rule as High King, as Celtic law required rulers to be physically unblemished, earning him the name Aulom ('one-eared'). This tale established Áine's role as a sovereign goddess who could grant or deny kingship.

**The Fitzgerald Connection**
Another notable legend connects Áine to the Fitzgerald dynasty. In this tale, she becomes the wife of Gerald FitzGerald, the 3rd Earl of Desmond, though their union begins with a similar act of violence. The story tells how she later uses her powers to transform him into a goose, highlighting her ability to punish those who wrong her.

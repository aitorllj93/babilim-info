## Myths and Legends

**The Daily Solar Journey**  
Every day, Sunna rides her chariot across the heavens, drawn by her two horses Árvakr ("Early Waker") and Alsviðr ("All Swift"). Before her chariot, the shield Svalinn is placed to protect the earth from burning under her intense radiance. She is eternally pursued by the wolf Sköll, who seeks to devour her – during solar eclipses, the wolf comes dangerously close to catching her.

**Ragnarök and Renewal**  
During Ragnarök, the twilight of the gods, Sköll finally catches and devours Sunna. However, before this occurs, she bears a daughter who will take her place, continuing her mother's journey across the skies in the renewed world that emerges after Ragnarök.

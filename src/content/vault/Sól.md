## Introduction
Sól (also known as Sunna) is the Norse goddess of the sun, who guides her shining chariot across the sky each day while eternally pursued by the wolf Sköll. Sister to [[Máni]], the moon god, she represents one of the most important celestial deities in Norse mythology, continuing the Indo-European tradition of [[*Seh₂ul]] through Germanic culture. Her dramatic fate during Ragnarök, where she is destined to be devoured by Sköll only to be succeeded by her daughter, adds a uniquely Norse dimension to the ancient solar deity archetype.

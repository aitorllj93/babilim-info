## Myths and Legends

**The Creation of Light**  
One of the most significant myths tells how Amalur created the celestial bodies to protect humanity. When humans were plagued by monsters in the eternal darkness, they pleaded to Amalur for help. She first created [[Ilargi]] (the Moon) to provide some light, but when this proved insufficient, she created [[Eguzki]] (the Sun). Finally, to protect humans during the night, she created the Eguzkilore (sun flower), which could be placed on doors to ward off evil spirits.

**The Earth's Treasures**  
Amalur's realm is said to contain vast treasures deep within the Earth. While humans have long sought these riches through cave exploration, legend says they can never be found. Instead, people would leave coin offerings in caves to gain Amalur's favor.

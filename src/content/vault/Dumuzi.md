As the divine shepherd and beloved consort of Inanna, his annual death and resurrection became one of humanity's earliest expressions of the eternal cycle of nature's renewal.

## Myths and Legends

**The Sacred Marriage**  
The central myth of Dumuzi involves his sacred marriage to Inanna, the goddess of love and fertility. This union was ritually reenacted annually by Sumerian kings and high priestesses, ensuring the land's fertility and abundance.

**Death and Resurrection**  
Dumuzi's most famous myth tells of his death and cyclical resurrection. When Inanna descended to the underworld, she was allowed to return only if she provided a replacement. She chose Dumuzi, who had not properly mourned her absence. He was then condemned to spend half the year in the underworld, while his sister Geshtinanna volunteered to take his place for the other half.

When Dumuzi comes up, the grain comes up"_

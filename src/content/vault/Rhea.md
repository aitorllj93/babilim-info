## Myths and Legends

**Saving Zeus**  
The most famous myth involving Rhea centers on her protection of the infant Zeus. When Kronos began swallowing their children to prevent them from overthrowing him, Rhea hid Zeus in a cave on Mount Ida in Crete. She then wrapped a stone in swaddling clothes, which Kronos swallowed instead <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Rhea/rhea.html" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Liberation of her Children**  
Working with Zeus after he reached maturity, Rhea helped devise a plan to force Kronos to disgorge her other children: [[Hestia]], [[Demeter]], [[Hera]], [[Poseidon]], and [[Hades]]. This act set in motion the Titanomachy, the great war between the Titans and the Olympians.

**Queen of the Golden Age**  
During the reign of the Titans, Rhea and Kronos ruled over what was later remembered as the Golden Age, a time of peace and abundance before the cosmic conflict that would establish Olympian rule.

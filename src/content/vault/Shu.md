##  Introduction
Shu was one of the primordial Egyptian deities, the god of air, light, and the space between heaven and earth. As the first-born son of Atum, he played a crucial role in maintaining cosmic order by eternally separating his children, the sky-goddess Nut from the earth-god Geb <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Shu/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Separation of Sky and Earth**  
In the beginning, sky (Nut) and earth (Geb) were locked in an eternal embrace. Ra ordered Shu to separate them, and he lifted Nut high above, creating the atmosphere and space where life could exist. Shu maintains this separation eternally, standing on Geb while holding up Nut <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Shu/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**Creation from Atum**  
Shu and his twin sister Tefnut were the first gods created by Atum, either through his spittle or through divine masturbation. Together, they represented the principles of life itself – air (Shu) and moisture (Tefnut) <mcreference link="https://egyptian-gods.org/egyptian-gods-shu/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

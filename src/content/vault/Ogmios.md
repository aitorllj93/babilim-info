## Myths and Legends

**Lucian's Account**
The most detailed account of Ogmios comes from the 2nd-century Syrian satirist Lucian, who described a Gaulish artwork depicting the god. In this image, Ogmios appeared as an elderly version of [[Heracles]], dark-skinned and weathered, yet maintaining the hero's traditional attributes of lion skin, club, and bow <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogmios" index="1">1</mcreference>.

Most strikingly, from his tongue extended fine chains of gold and amber that connected to the ears of a group of joyful followers. These chains represented the power of eloquence, binding listeners not through force but through the pleasure of his words <mcreference link="https://oldworldgods.com/celtics/ogmios-celtic-god/" index="4">4</mcreference>.

**The Brigantium Curses**
Two curse tablets found at Brigantium (modern Bregenz, Austria) invoke Ogmios alongside [[Dis Pater]] and [[Aeracura]], suggesting his role may have extended to the underworld and binding magic <mcreference link="https://mythus.fandom.com/wiki/Ogmios" index="2">2</mcreference>.

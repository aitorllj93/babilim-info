## Myths and Legends

**The Resurrection of Osiris**  
The most famous myth of Isis tells of her tireless search for her husband Osiris, who was murdered and dismembered by his jealous brother Seth.

**Protection of Horus**  
After conceiving Horus, Isis hid in the marshes of the Nile Delta to protect her son from Seth. She used her magic to defend the child against dangerous creatures and raised him until he could claim his father's throne.

In another significant myth, Isis tricked the sun god Ra into revealing his secret name by creating a serpent that poisoned him, offering to heal him only if he revealed his true name, thus gaining power over him.

## Myths and Legends

**The Curse of Macha**
The most famous tale of Macha involves her marriage to a farmer named Cruinniuc. When he boasted that his wife could outrun the king's horses, she was forced to race while heavily pregnant. Despite her pleas, she was made to run, and though she won, she gave birth to twins at the finish line. With her dying breath, she cursed the men of Ulster to suffer the pangs of childbirth in their hour of greatest need, a curse that would last for nine generations.

**The Founding of Emain Macha**
As Macha Mong Ruad (Red-Haired Macha), she was a warrior-queen who founded the royal site of Emain Macha (modern-day Navan Fort). She marked out the fort's boundaries with her brooch (Emain means "brooch"), creating one of Ireland's most important ancient royal sites.

**The Three Machas**
In Irish mythology, there are three significant Machas:
1. Macha, wife of [[Nemed]], who died clearing plains
2. Macha Mong Ruad, the warrior-queen
3. Macha, wife of Cruinniuc, who cursed Ulster

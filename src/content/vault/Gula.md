## Introduction

Gula, the Sumerian goddess of healing and divine physician, stands as one of the most revered deities in ancient Mesopotamian religion. Known as the "Great Physician of the Black-Headed Ones" (the Sumerians), she embodied the sacred intersection of divine mercy and mortal healing. Over the course of the second and first millennia BCE, she ascended to become one of the main deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon, eventually viewed as the second highest-ranked goddess after [[Ishtar]]. Her compassionate nature and healing powers made her essential to both royal courts and common households throughout ancient Mesopotamia.

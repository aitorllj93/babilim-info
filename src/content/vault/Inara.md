## Myths and Legends

**The Defeat of Illuyanka**  
Inara's most famous myth involves her crucial role in defeating the dragon Illuyanka, who had previously bested her father [[Tarhunna]] in battle. She devised a clever plan, organizing a great feast (possibly the Purulli festival) to trap the dragon. She enlisted the help of a mortal named Hupasiyas of Zigaratta, becoming his lover in exchange for his aid. During the feast, Inara ensured Illuyanka and his family consumed excessive food and drink until they were unable to move. This allowed Hupasiyas to bind them with ropes, enabling [[Tarhunna]] to defeat his enemy and preserve creation.

**The House on the Cliff**  
After the defeat of Illuyanka, Inara built a house on a cliff for Hupasiyas. She gave him strict instructions never to look out the window, warning that he might see his family. However, Hupasiyas disobeyed and, upon seeing his family, begged to return home. The conclusion of this tale remains ambiguous - some versions suggest Inara killed him for his disobedience or hubris, while others indicate she may have allowed him to return to his family.

**The Disappearance of Inara**  
In another significant myth, the mother goddess [[Hannahanna]] promised Inara land and a man during a consultation. Subsequently, Inara disappeared, leading to a search by her father with [[Hannahanna]]'s help, who sent a bee to aid in the search. This narrative bears similarities to the Greek myth of [[Demeter]] and [[Persephone]].

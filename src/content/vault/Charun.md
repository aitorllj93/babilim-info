## Myths and Legends

**Guardian of the Gateway**  
Charun stood guard at the entrance to the underworld, using his hammer not as a weapon but as a tool of office, marking the boundary between the world of the living and the dead. His presence was considered essential for the proper transition of souls.

**Collaboration with [[Vanth]]**  
Charun often worked alongside [[Vanth]], another Etruscan psychopomp, in guiding souls to their final destination. While [[Vanth]] was typically depicted as more benevolent, Charun represented the more fearsome aspects of death.

**Tomb Paintings**  
Charun appears frequently in Etruscan tomb paintings, particularly in the necropolises of Tarquinia and Cerveteri, where he is shown escorting the deceased on their final journey.

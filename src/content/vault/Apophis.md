## Myths and Legends

**The Eternal Battle with Ra**
The most significant myth involving Apophis was his nightly battle with [[Ra]]. As Ra's solar barque traveled through the underworld each night, Apophis would attempt to attack and devour the sun god, threatening to plunge the world into eternal darkness. This battle represented the constant struggle between chaos (isfet) and order (ma'at).

> "Each night Apophis encountered Re at a particular hour in the sun god's ritual journey through the underworld in his divine bark. [[Set]], who rode as guardian in the front of Re's bark, attacked him with a spear and slew him, but the next night Apophis, who could not be permanently subdued, was there again to attack Re."

**The Solar Eclipse**
Egyptians believed that solar eclipses occurred when Apophis managed to temporarily swallow Ra's solar boat. However, Ra would always emerge victorious, ensuring the sun's return.

## Myths and Legends

**Creation of Humanity**  
Ea created humans from clay mixed with the blood of a slain god, [[Kingu]], to serve the gods. Unlike other deities, he often showed compassion for his creation, repeatedly intervening to save humanity from divine punishment.

**The Abzu**  
Ea ruled over the Abzu (or ApsÃ»), the freshwater ocean beneath the earth. This was both his domain and the source of his wisdom, where he maintained his temple and governed the sacred ME (divine powers).

**Flood Story**  
In the famous flood narrative, Ea warned Utnapishtim (the Babylonian Noah) of the coming deluge, instructing him to build an ark and thus preserve life on earth, defying the other gods' decision to destroy humanity.

> _"I will unfold to you, Utnapishtim, a secret of the gods"_  
â€” From the Epic of Gilgamesh

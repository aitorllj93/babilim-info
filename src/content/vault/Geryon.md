## Myths and Legends

**The Tenth Labor of Heracles**  
The most famous myth involving Geryon centers on [[Heracles]]' tenth labor. Commanded by [[Eurystheus]], [[Heracles]] had to travel to the distant island of Erytheia to steal Geryon's prized red cattle. After a long journey, [[Heracles]] confronted Geryon, who was aided by his herdsman Eurytion and the two-headed dog Orthrus. Despite Geryon's tremendous strength and triple form, [[Heracles]] succeeded in slaying him with his poisoned arrows <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/Monsters/Geryon/geryon.html" index="2">2</mcreference>.

> _"And now Geryon's fate was sealed: for as each of his three forms stepped forth to fight, each fell in turn to Heracles' arrows, and the mighty giant toppled like three towers brought low."_

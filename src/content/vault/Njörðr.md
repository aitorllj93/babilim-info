## Introduction
Njord (Old Norse: Njörðr) was the Vanir god of the sea, seafaring, wind, fishing, wealth, and crop fertility in Norse mythology. As one of the most important deities of the Vanir tribe, he later became an honorary member of the Aesir following the Aesir-Vanir war, serving as a symbol of the prosperous relationship between the two divine families.

## Myths and Legends

**Marriage to Skadi**  
One of the most famous myths involving Njord tells of his marriage to the giantess [[Skadi]]. After the death of her father [[Thiazi]], Skadi came to the Aesir seeking compensation. She was allowed to choose a husband from among the gods, but had to make her selection based only on their feet. Hoping to choose [[Baldr]], she instead chose Njord. Their marriage was ultimately doomed due to their inability to compromise on where to live - Njord couldn't stand the mountains of Thrymheim, while Skadi couldn't bear the sounds of seabirds at Noatun.

> _"Nine nights in the mountains, but then the howling of the wolves seemed to me hideous compared with the song of the swans."_  
> — Njord's words from the Prose Edda

**Other Myths**  
- Role in the Aesir-Vanir War and subsequent peace

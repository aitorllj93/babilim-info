## Myths and Legends

**The Daily Renewal**  
In Lithuanian folklore, Aušra appears each morning to herald the arrival of [[Saulė]], the sun goddess. While [[Aušrinė]] and her servant Tarnaitis prepare the way for the sun <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aušrinė" index="1">1</mcreference>, Aušra represents the very moment of dawn itself – that magical transition from darkness to light.

**The Lost Keys Riddle**  
In Baltic folk tradition, particularly Latvian riddles, there is a story of a maiden who loses her keys (or spreads her pearl necklace), the Moon sees them, but the Sun takes them. The answer to this riddle is connected to the dawn goddesses, including Aušra <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aušrinė" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Introduction
The Proto-Germanic goddess *Austrōn represents the divine personification of dawn in early Germanic religious thought. As a direct descendant of the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess [[*H₂éwsōs]], she forms a crucial link in understanding how the Indo-European dawn deity evolved in Germanic cultures, eventually giving rise to the better-documented [[Ēostre]] <mcreference link="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1453022" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Mythological Significance

**Dawn Goddess Tradition**
As a continuation of the Proto-Indo-European dawn goddess [[*H₂éwsōs]], *Austrōn maintained the fundamental association with the daily miracle of dawn. Her worship likely involved celebrations of both the daily dawn and the spring season, when her power was considered strongest <mcreference link="https://www.academia.edu/44182476/Germanic_Dawn_Goddess" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Spring and Renewal**
The connection between dawn and spring in Germanic tradition suggests that *Austrōn was not only a goddess of daily renewal but also of seasonal rebirth. This dual aspect of renewal became particularly emphasized in her later form as [[Ēostre]], whose festival marked the spring equinox.

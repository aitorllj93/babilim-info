## Myths and Legends

**Birth and Casting from Olympus**  
Born to [[Hera]] (and Zeus in some versions), Hephaestus was cast from Olympus due to his lameness. Another version states that Zeus threw him from heaven for taking [[Hera]]'s side in a dispute, resulting in his characteristic limp.

**Marriage to Aphrodite**  
Zeus gave him [[Aphrodite]] as wife to prevent conflict among the gods over her beauty. Their marriage was troubled, particularly due to Aphrodite's famous affair with [[Ares]].

**The Golden Net**  
Upon discovering Aphrodite's infidelity with Ares, Hephaestus crafted an invisible, unbreakable net to catch them in the act, then summoned the gods to witness their shame.

**Divine Craftworks**  
Hephaestus created numerous legendary items:
- [[Zeus]]'s thunderbolts
- [[Achilles]]' shield and armor
- [[Hermes]]' winged sandals
- [[Athena]]'s aegis
- The golden automata that served in his forge

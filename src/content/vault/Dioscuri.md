## Myths and Legends

**Divine Parentage**  
The twins were born to Leda, though their parentage was complex. According to the most common tradition, Pollux was the divine son of Zeus (who approached Leda as a swan), while Castor was the mortal son of Tyndareus, king of Sparta.

**Heroic Exploits**  
The Dioscuri participated in numerous heroic adventures, including:
- The voyage of the Argonauts
- The Calydonian Boar hunt
- The rescue of their sister [[Helen]] from Theseus
- The battle with Idas and Lynceus over the daughters of Leucippus

**Shared Immortality**  
When Castor was killed in battle, Pollux begged Zeus to share his immortality with his brother. Zeus granted them the ability to alternate between Olympus and the Underworld, spending each day in turn between the realms of the living and the dead.

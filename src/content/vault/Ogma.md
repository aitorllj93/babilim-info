## Myths and Legends

**The Champion's Trial**  
During the reign of Bres, when the Tuatha Dé Danann were reduced to servitude, Ogma alone maintained his position as champion through his extraordinary strength. Despite being forced to carry firewood, he continued to prove his athletic and martial prowess in contests before the king.

**The Contest with Lugh**  
When [[Lugh]] arrived at Tara, Ogma challenged him by lifting and hurling a massive flagstone that normally required eighty oxen to move. Lugh matched this feat, leading to a mutual respect between the two powerful deities.

**The Battle of Mag Tuired**  
In the great battle against the Fomorians, Ogma served as [[Lugh]]'s champion, promising to repel the Fomorian king Indech and his bodyguard. During the battle, he claimed the sword Orna from the Fomorian king Tethra, a weapon that would recount all the deeds done with it when unsheathed.

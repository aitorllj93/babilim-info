According to the tale, when Zeus lay with Leto and she became pregnant with Apollo and Artemis, Hera sent Python to pursue the goddess relentlessly. When Apollo was born and merely four days old, he sought vengeance. He tracked Python to its lair at Delphi and slew it with a volley of arrows <mcreference link="https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/python.html" index="5">5</mcreference>.

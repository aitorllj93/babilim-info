## Myths and Legends

According to Baltic folklore, Ūsiņš personally oversees the care of horses, who are seen as transporters of the sun itself. His deep connection to horses is reflected in numerous folk songs that describe him riding to pieguļa (night pasture) with nine foals.

As a god of light, Ūsiņš is believed to bring forth the spring, bestowing green grass upon fields and leaves upon trees. His arrival marks the transition from winter to summer, embodying the regenerative powers of nature.

> "To the hill Ūsiņš rode / With a stone foal; / He brought leaves to trees, / Green clover to the land."
> — Latvian Folk Song (daina) 30063

## Introduction
Varuna (Sanskrit: वरुण) stands as one of the most ancient and venerated deities in the Vedic pantheon. Originally a supreme god of the cosmic waters and celestial ocean, he was the upholder of Rita (cosmic order), overseer of moral law, and punisher of those who transgressed divine ordinances. His all-seeing nature and role as guardian of truth made him one of the most significant deities in early Vedic religion.

## Myths and Legends

**The All-Seeing God**
Varuna's thousand eyes are the stars in the night sky, through which he observes all human actions and judges their adherence to Rita. His noose (pasha) catches those who violate cosmic law, binding them in spiritual bondage.

**Varuna and Mitra**
In early Vedic tradition, Varuna formed a divine pair with [[Mitra]], together representing cosmic and moral order. While Mitra governed the day, Varuna ruled the night, maintaining balance in the universe.

**The Bargain with [[Indra]]**
As Vedic religion evolved, Varuna gradually ceded his position as the supreme deity to Indra. This transition is reflected in various myths where Indra assumes greater prominence in the pantheon.

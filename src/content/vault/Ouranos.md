## Myths and Legends

**Main Myth**  
The central myth of Ouranos involves his union with [[Gaia]] and subsequent overthrow. After birthing the Titans, Hekatonkheires, and Cyclopes, Ouranos imprisoned his children within Gaia's body. In pain, Gaia crafted a great adamantine sickle and conspired with her son [[Kronos]], who used it to castrate his father. From Ouranos's spilled blood arose the Erinyes, Giants, and Meliae nymphs, while from his severed genitals cast into the sea, [[Aphrodite]] was born.

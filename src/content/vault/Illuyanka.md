## Myths and Legends

**First Version of the Battle**  
In the first version of the myth, Illuyanka defeats the Storm God in initial combat. The Storm God's daughter then arranges a feast where Illuyanka and his children eat and drink until they cannot return to their lair. This allows a mortal named Ḫupašiya to bind the dragon with rope, enabling the Storm God to kill Illuyanka.

**Second Version of the Battle**  
The alternative version tells how the Storm God loses his heart and eyes to Illuyanka in their first battle. The Storm God then marries a mortal woman who bears him a son. This son marries Illuyanka's daughter and, at his father's request, asks for the return of the Storm God's heart and eyes. Once restored, the Storm God defeats Illuyanka but also kills his own son in the process.

**The Purulli Festival**  
These myths were recited during the Purulli spring festival, celebrating the victory of order over chaos and the renewal of life. The festival's name derives from "purulli-" meaning "earth" in Hittite, suggesting connections to agricultural fertility.

## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Lover**
As a priestess of Zeus, Semele caught the god's attention while performing a sacrifice at his altar. Zeus, disguised as an eagle, observed her ritual cleansing in the Asopus river and was immediately smitten. Their subsequent love affair would become one of the most famous in Greek mythology <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semele" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Fatal Wish**
When Semele became pregnant, Zeus's wife [[Hera]], consumed by jealousy, disguised herself as an old nurse named Beroe. She planted seeds of doubt in Semele's mind about her lover's true identity. Encouraged by Hera's manipulation, Semele asked Zeus to grant her one wish. Bound by his oath on the River Styx, Zeus was forced to comply with her request to see him in his true divine form. Despite Zeus's attempts to minimize his divine glory, the sight of his complete divinity proved too much for a mortal to bear, and Semele was consumed by lightning <mcreference link="https://www.thoughtco.com/semele-111783" index="5">5</mcreference>.

**The Rescue and Apotheosis**
Years later, after [[Dionysus]] had grown to maturity, he descended into the Underworld to rescue his mother. Bringing her back to the world of the living, he elevated her to divine status. Renamed as Thyone, she took her place on Mount Olympus, where she presides over the sacred frenzy inspired by her son's rites <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Myths/The_Myths/Zeus's_Lovers/Semele/semele.html" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Birth of Mars**  
One of the most notable myths involves the birth of Mars, where Juno, angry at Jupiter for giving birth to Minerva from his head, sought the help of Flora to conceive without her husband. Flora provided her with a magical flower that allowed her to conceive Mars independently.

**Guardian of Rome**  
As Juno Moneta ("the Warner"), she saved Rome by having the sacred geese of her temple raise an alarm during the Gallic invasion of 390 BCE. This led to her temple becoming the site of Rome's first mint, giving us the word "money."

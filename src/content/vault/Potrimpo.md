## Myths and Legends

**The Sacred Trinity**  
In Old Prussian mythology, Potrimpo formed part of a divine trinity alongside [[Perkūnas]], the thunder god, and [[Peckols]], the god of the underworld and death. This trinity represented the complete cycle of existence: Potrimpo governing growth and vitality, Perkūnas providing the necessary storms for crops, and Peckols ruling over decay and death <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prussian_mythology" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Temple of Romuva**  
According to historical accounts, a copper idol in the form of a twisted žaltys (sacred snake) representing Potrimpo stood in the temple of Romuva. The snake was considered his sacred creature and was given offerings of milk, symbolizing the god's connection to fertility and abundance <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potrimpo" index="2">2</mcreference>.

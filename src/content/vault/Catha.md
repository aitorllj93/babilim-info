## Introduction

Catha (Etruscan: 𐌀𐌈𐌀𐌂, romanized: Catha, also written 𐌈𐌀𐌂, Cath, 𐌀𐌈𐌖𐌀𐌂, Cautha, or 𐌀𐌈𐌅𐌀𐌊, Kavtha) was a complex Etruscan deity associated with both solar and lunar aspects, childbirth, and the underworld. As one of the most enigmatic figures in the Etruscan pantheon, Catha embodied the liminal spaces between light and darkness, life and death, making her a crucial mediator between realms. Her worship was particularly prominent at Pyrgi, where she served as the goddess of the south sanctuary, and her importance is evidenced by her inclusion on the sacred Piacenza Liver, a bronze model used for divination.

## Myths and Legends

**The Daughter of the Sun**  
Catha was known as "śech" (daughter) and specifically called "the Daughter of the Sun" in ancient texts. This relationship positioned her as both heir to solar power and intermediary between the sun god and mortals. Unlike her father [[Usil]], who embodied the full power of the sun, Catha represented the gentler aspects of solar energy - dawn's first light and the moon's reflected radiance.

> _"For Cautha, the annually appointed village priest will dedicate 80 ez. In addition, dedications must be made in the place of offering, at the stream Casthia, where it empties into the lake"_  
> — Lead Plaque of Magliano (Etruscan ritual inscription)

**The Rising from the Sea**  
Both Catha and [[Usil]] were described as rising from the sea at dawn, carrying blazing flames. This mythological motif, though geographically puzzling given Etruria's western coastline, suggests either borrowed iconography from eastern cultures or symbolic rather than literal interpretation of the sea as the primordial waters of creation.

**The Psychopomp Function**  
Artistic depictions show Catha with two horses instead of the traditional four, indicating her role in guiding the deceased to the afterlife. This function connected her solar aspects with chthonic duties, making her a bridge between the world of the living and the realm of the dead.

## Worship and Rituals

- **Forms of worship**: Priesthood (maru Cathsc), annual dedications, votive offerings
- **Festivals**: Annual ceremonies at stream Casthia, seasonal dawn rituals
- **Sacred spaces**: South sanctuary at Pyrgi, sacred alcoves, memorial sites
- **Archaeological remains**: Gold earrings from Pyrgi (530-520 BCE), bronze inscriptions, terracotta heads, antefixes

The Sarcophagus of Laris Pulenas from Tarquinia (3rd century BCE) identifies its occupant as a "priest of Catha," demonstrating the formal religious hierarchy dedicated to her worship. Votive inscriptions and dedicated objects, particularly from necropoleis, show her importance in funerary rites.

## Later Influence

- **Syncretism**: Identified with Greek Leucothea, potentially linked to Persephone through her consort [[Śuri]]'s connection to Dis Pater
- **Legacy in later religions**: Her solar-lunar duality may have influenced later Roman concepts of Sol and Luna
- **Academic significance**: Central to modern understanding of Etruscan gender fluidity in divine representation

## Modern Interpretations

- **Psychological/archetypal readings**: Represents the anima/animus principle, bridging masculine solar and feminine lunar energies
- **Comparative mythology**: Similar dual-nature deities found in Celtic, Germanic, and Anatolian traditions
- **Recent academic theories**: Nancy de Grummond's lunar interpretation challenges traditional solar classifications, suggesting Catha as primarily lunar with solar epithets

## Myths and Legends

**The Love of Cybele**  
The central myth tells of Attis, a beautiful shepherd boy loved by [[Cybele]]. Different versions exist, but the most common tells that Cybele discovered Attis was to be married to a mortal woman. In divine jealousy, she drove him mad. In his frenzy, Attis castrated himself under a pine tree and bled to death <mcreference link="https://www.theoi.com/Phrygios/Attis.html" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Death and Resurrection**  
Cybele, grief-stricken, appealed to Zeus to preserve Attis's body. His body remained incorrupt, his hair continued to grow, and he was resurrected as an evergreen pine tree. This cycle of death and rebirth became central to his mystery cult <mcreference link="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Attis" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The Pine Tree**  
The pine tree became sacred to both Attis and Cybele, symbolizing immortality and resurrection. During festivals, a pine tree would be cut down and brought to the temple, wrapped like a corpse, symbolizing Attis's death and rebirth.

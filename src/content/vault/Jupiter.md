## Introduction
Jupiter (Iuppiter) was the king of the Roman gods and the supreme deity of the Roman state religion. As the head of the Capitoline Triad and the patron deity of Rome itself, he embodied divine authority, justice, and the power of the Roman state. His thunderbolt was both a symbol of his supreme power and a tool of divine justice.

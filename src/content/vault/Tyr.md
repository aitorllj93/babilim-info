## Myths and Legends

**The Binding of Fenrir**  
The most famous myth involving Tyr tells of his role in the binding of [[Fenrir]], the monstrous wolf. When the gods decided to bind Fenrir with the unbreakable fetter Gleipnir, the wolf would only allow himself to be bound if one of the gods placed their hand in his mouth as a pledge of good faith. Only Tyr was brave enough to do so, knowing that Fenrir would bite off his hand when the gods refused to release him.

> _"Then they beheld how Tyr had his right hand lying in the wolf's mouth as a pledge, and when the Æsir refused to loose him, then Fenrir bit off his hand at the place now called 'the wolf's joint.'"_  
> — Prose Edda

**Other Myths**

- Ancient leadership role – Evidence suggests Tyr was once chief of the Germanic pantheon

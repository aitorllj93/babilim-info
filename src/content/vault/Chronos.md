## Introduction
Chronos is the primordial deity of time in Greek mythology and philosophy, particularly prominent in Orphic traditions. Often depicted as an incorporeal god or a serpent with three heads, he emerged from the primordial void to initiate cosmic motion. It's crucial to distinguish him from [[Kronos]] (the Titan father of [[Zeus]]), though later traditions sometimes conflated the two deities.

## Myths and Legends

**Orphic Creation**
In Orphic tradition, Chronos emerged from the primordial void and created the cosmic egg from which [[Phanes]], the first-born of the gods, emerged. This act initiated the cycle of creation and the flow of time itself.

**The Dance of Time**
Chronos was said to dance eternally, moving in a spiral that created the flow of time and the cycles of the cosmos. This dance determined the rhythm of existence itself.

**The Three-Headed Serpent**
Chronos was often depicted as a serpentine deity with three heads - those of a man, a bull, and a lion - representing the different aspects of time's flow and its power over all creation.

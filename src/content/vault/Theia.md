## Introduction

Theia was one of the twelve primordial Titans of Greek mythology, revered as the goddess of sight, divine light, and the shimmering aether of the bright blue sky. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia" index="1">1</mcreference> As the divine mother of the celestial trio—Helios (Sun), Selene (Moon), and Eos (Dawn)—she held dominion over all forms of heavenly luminescence and was believed to bestow brilliance upon precious metals and gems. <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html" index="3">3</mcreference> Though she features less prominently in mythological narratives than her illustrious children, Theia represents the fundamental cosmic principle of divine illumination that bridges the earthly and celestial realms.

## Myths and Legends

**The Birth of the Celestial Lights**  
Theia united with her Titan brother [[Hyperion]] to produce the three great lights of heaven. Their children became the personifications of celestial illumination: [[Helios]] driving his golden chariot across the sky as the Sun, [[Selene]] riding through the night as the Moon, and [[Eos]] opening the gates of dawn with her rosy fingers. <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Titans/Thea/thea.html" index="3">3</mcreference>

> _"Theia's illustrious progeny"_  
> — Catullus, describing the Sun, Moon, and Dawn <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia" index="1">1</mcreference>

**The Fabled Dress of Selene**  
Plutarch recounts a touching fable where [[Selene]] asked her mother Theia to weave her a garment to fit her measure. Theia replied that she was unable to do so, as Selene kept changing shape and size—sometimes full, then crescent-shaped, and at other times half her size—never staying the same. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia" index="1">1</mcreference>

**The Origin of Precious Metals' Brilliance**  
Ancient Greeks believed that gold and silver derived their lustrous shine directly from Theia's divine light. The radiance of these precious metals was considered a reflection of her celestial illumination, making them sacred and valuable beyond their material worth. <mcreference link="https://www.ebsco.com/research-starters/religion-and-philosophy/theia-greek-goddess" index="5">5</mcreference>

**Diodorus's Unconventional Tale**  
In an alternative version by Diodorus Siculus, Theia appears as "Basileia," a wise ruler chosen by [[Uranus]] to succeed him. When her children were murdered by her jealous brothers, she received a vision promising they would be honored as celestial lights, which she then fulfilled by establishing their worship. <mcreference link="https://learning-history.com/greek-goddess-theia/" index="1">1</mcreference>

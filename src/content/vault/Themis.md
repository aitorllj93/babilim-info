##  Introduction
Themis, one of the twelve original Titans, stands as the divine embodiment of justice, law, and cosmic order in Greek mythology. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis" index="1">1</mcreference> As daughter of Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky), she represents the fundamental laws that govern both divine and mortal realms. Unlike human-made legislation, Themis personifies the inherent, unchangeable principles that maintain universal harmony. <mcreference link="https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanisThemis.html" index="2">2</mcreference> Her influence extends far beyond mere jurisprudence, encompassing prophecy, social customs, and the very foundations of civilized society.

## Etymology

- **Root meaning**: From the Greek verb τίθημι (títhēmi), meaning "to put" or "to place" <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis" index="1">1</mcreference>
- **Language of origin**: Ancient Greek Θέμις (Thémis)
- **Literal translation**: "That which is put in place" or "that which is established" <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/themis" index="4">4</mcreference>

> — Moses Finley, on Homer's use of the term <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Myths and Legends

**The Oracle of Delphi**  
Themis inherited the oracular powers at Delphi from her mother Gaia, serving as the second keeper of this sacred site before eventually gifting it to Apollo. <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/themis" index="4">4</mcreference> In this role, she delivered the first divine laws to humanity, establishing the fundamental principles of piety, hospitality, and justice.

**The Prophecy of Thetis**  
One of her most crucial prophecies warned Zeus and Poseidon not to marry the sea-nymph Thetis, as her son would be mightier than his father. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis" index="1">1</mcreference> This prophecy led to Thetis's marriage to the mortal Peleus, resulting in the birth of Achilles.

**The Great Flood**  
According to Ovid, it was Themis who instructed Deucalion to throw "the bones of his mother" (stones of Mother Earth) over his shoulder to repopulate the world after the great deluge. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis" index="1">1</mcreference>

> _"Zeus, from the many-folded peak of Olympos, told Themis to summon all the gods into assembly"_  
> — Homer, Iliad <mcreference link="https://www.theoi.com/Titan/TitanisThemis.html" index="2">2</mcreference>

**Other Prophetic Visions**
- Warned the gods of the coming civil war in Thebes <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis" index="1">1</mcreference>
- Prophesied that a son of Zeus would steal golden apples from Atlas's orchard <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Themis" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Later Influence

- **Legal tradition**: Foundation of Western concepts of natural law and divine justice
- **Modern symbolism**: Evolved into "Lady Justice" in contemporary legal iconography <mcreference link="https://mythopedia.com/topics/themis" index="4">4</mcreference>

## Modern Interpretations

- **Archetypal analysis**: Represents the anima of cosmic order and the collective unconscious's need for justice
- **Comparative mythology**: Parallels with Egyptian Maat, Vedic Ṛta, and Avestan Asha as universal principles of order
- **Legal philosophy**: Central to natural law theory and discussions of inherent versus legislated justice
- **Feminist interpretations**: Seen as representing pre-patriarchal divine feminine wisdom and earth-based law

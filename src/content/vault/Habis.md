## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Child's Survival**  
Habis's story begins with a forbidden union between his mother and his grandfather [[Gargoris]], the king of Tartessos. According to the legend, his mother was stung by a bee, and when [[Gargoris]] attempted to heal her wound with his mouth, passion overcame them both. When Habis was born, [[Gargoris]], ashamed of the incestuous union, ordered the infant to be abandoned in the wilderness <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habis" index="2">2</mcreference>.

Miraculously, the child survived and was raised by deer in the forest, developing deer-like characteristics. Eventually, he was discovered and recognized as the true heir to the kingdom, fulfilling his destiny to become a wise and benevolent ruler <mcreference link="https://raed.academy/en/gargoris-and-habidis/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Daily Solar Journey**  
Ra's most fundamental myth describes his daily journey across the sky in his solar bark. Each day, he would emerge from the eastern horizon, traveling across the heavens in his day-bark called Mandjet. At sunset, he would begin his perilous night journey through the underworld in his night-bark called Mesektet, fighting the serpent [[Apophis]] who sought to destroy him and prevent the sun's return <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Ra_(Egyptian_God)/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**Creation of the World**  
As a creator god, Ra emerged from the primordial waters of [[Nun]], standing upon the first mound of creation. He then produced the first gods through his creative powers, either through spitting or through his divine utterance <mcreference link="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Re" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Secret Name of Ra**  
One of the most famous myths involves [[Isis]] who sought to gain power over Ra by learning his secret name. She created a serpent to poison him and only offered the cure if he revealed his true name, thus gaining power over him <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/article/885/the-secret-name-of-ra/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

## Introduction
Nuada Airgetlám ("of the Silver Arm") was the first king of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], the divine tribe of ancient Ireland. His story embodies the Celtic ideal of kingship, where physical perfection was intrinsically linked to the right to rule, and his silver prosthetic arm represents one of the earliest tales of magical biomechanical enhancement in world mythology.

## Myths and Legends

**The Loss of Kingship**  
During the First Battle of Mag Tuired against the [[Fir Bolg]], Nuada lost his arm in combat with their champion Sreng. According to Celtic law, no king could have a physical blemish, forcing him to abdicate in favor of [[Bres]] the Beautiful, who proved to be a tyrannical ruler.

**The Silver Arm**  
Dianecht, the physician of the Tuatha Dé Danann, crafted a fully functional silver arm for Nuada. Later, Dianecht's son Miach went further by causing flesh to grow over it. This restoration allowed Nuada to reclaim his kingship from Bres, leading to the Second Battle of Mag Tuired.

**The Second Battle of Mag Tuired**  
Nuada led the Tuatha Dé Danann against the [[Fomorians]], but ultimately fell in combat against the monstrous [[Balor]]. He was succeeded by [[Lugh]], who avenged his death by slaying Balor.

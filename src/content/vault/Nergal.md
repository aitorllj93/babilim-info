## Myths and Legends

**The Marriage of Nergal and Ereshkigal**
The most famous myth involving Nergal tells of his relationship with [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the underworld. After offending her messenger Namtar at a divine banquet, Nergal was forced to descend to the underworld to apologize. There, he and Ereshkigal became lovers for six days, but Nergal abandoned her to return to heaven. Ereshkigal's grief led the gods to send Nergal back, resulting in their permanent union and his co-rulership of the underworld.

In this tale, Nergal (as Erra) goes on a destructive rampage, showcasing his uncontrollable nature and tendency toward violence. His attendant deity Ishum must intervene to stop his destruction.

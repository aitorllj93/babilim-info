## Myths and Legends

**The Foundation of Germanic Tribes**  
According to Tacitus, Mannus had three sons who became the ancestors of three major Germanic tribal groupings:
- The Ingvaeones (North Sea Germanic peoples)
- The Herminones (Elbe Germanic peoples)
- The Istvaeones (Rhine-Weser Germanic peoples)

This tripartite division became fundamental to Germanic tribal identity and social organization.

**Divine Lineage**  
As the son of [[Tuisto]], who emerged from the earth itself, Mannus bridges the gap between divine and human realms. His position as both divine offspring and father of humanity establishes the sacred connection between the Germanic peoples and their gods.

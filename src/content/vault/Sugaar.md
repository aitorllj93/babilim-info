## Introduction
Sugaar (also known as Sugar, Sugoi, Suarra, or Maju) is one of the most significant deities in Basque mythology, representing the male aspect of the pre-Christian pantheon. As the divine consort of [[Mari]], he embodies the forces of storms, thunder, and the fertilizing rains that bring life to the earth. His manifestations as both serpent and lightning symbolize the dynamic forces of nature that the ancient Basques both revered and feared.

## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Union**
The most significant myth involving Sugaar tells of his periodic meetings with the goddess [[Mari]], typically occurring on Friday evenings. Their union is said to generate the great storms that sweep across the Basque mountains. This sacred marriage represents the joining of sky and earth forces, bringing the rains that fertilize the land.

**The Birth of Jaun Zuria**
In one notable legend, Sugaar appears to a Scottish princess in the village of Mundaka. From their union was born Jaun Zuria, the mythical first Lord of Biscay. While historians consider this tale a political fabrication to legitimize Biscay's independence from Navarre, it demonstrates Sugaar's importance in Basque cultural identity.

**The Two Homes**
In Ataun, local lore speaks of Sugaar's two dwellings: the caves of Amunda and Atarreta. He emerges from these underground lairs to traverse the sky as a fiery crescent, his passage presaging the coming of storms.

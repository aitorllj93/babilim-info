## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Triad**  
Tinia ruled as part of the supreme triad alongside his consort [[Uni]] (equivalent to Hera/Juno) and [[Menrva]] (Minerva/Athena). This triad was central to Etruscan state religion and was honored in the main temples of Etruscan cities.

**The Three Thunderbolts**  
Unique to Etruscan theology, Tinia possessed three different types of thunderbolts, each serving a different purpose:
- First type: Warning signs sent at his own discretion
- Second type: Beneficial bolts, but requiring consultation with other gods
- Third type: Devastating bolts of destruction, requiring approval from hidden gods

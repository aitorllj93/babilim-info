## Myths and Legends

**The Rape of Proserpina**  
The central myth tells how Pluto, god of the underworld, abducted Proserpina while she gathered flowers. Her mother Ceres, goddess of agriculture, searched the earth, neglecting her duties and causing famine. Jupiter intervened, decreeing that Proserpina would spend part of the year with her mother (spring/summer) and part with Pluto (fall/winter).

**The Pomegranate Seeds**  
During her time in the underworld, Proserpina ate six pomegranate seeds, binding her to return for six months each year. This explained the cycle of seasons: the earth bloomed when she returned to her mother and withered when she descended to her husband's realm.

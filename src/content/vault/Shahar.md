## Myths and Legends

**The Birth of the Divine Twins**  
According to Ugaritic mythology, Shahar and his twin brother [[Shalim]] were born to the supreme god [[El]]. The myth describes their conception after El encounters two women by the seashore. The twins were then nursed by "The Lady" (likely [[Asherah]]) and were known for their voracious appetites, described as reaching "one lip to earth and one lip to heaven."

**Venus and the Morning Star**  
Shahar's association with the morning star (Venus) played a significant role in ancient Near Eastern astronomy and mythology. This connection is particularly notable in the biblical book of Isaiah, where the phrase "Hēlēl ben Šāḥar" (Morning Star, son of Dawn) appears.

##  Introduction
Radegast stands as one of the most enigmatic figures in Slavic mythology—a deity whose very name embodies the sacred law of hospitality that defined ancient Slavic culture. Worshipped primarily by the Polabian Slavs in their great temple city of Rethra, Radegast was revered as both the guardian of sacred guests and the solar deity who brought warmth and abundance to the land. Though modern scholarship debates whether Radegast was a distinct god or a local epithet for the solar deity Svarozhits, his influence as the divine protector of hospitality, war, and harvest remains central to understanding Slavic spiritual traditions.

## Myths and Legends

**The Golden Guardian of Rethra**  
In the great temple of Rethra, Radegast's golden statue stood upon a purple-draped pedestal, its surface gleaming with divine fire. Pilgrims traveled from distant Slavic lands to seek his blessing for safe journeys and bountiful harvests. The statue depicted him as a warrior-guardian, holding a spear to smite enemies and a shield bearing the sacred bull's head—symbol of his protective power over both guests and cities.

> _"His statue is made of gold, his baldachin bedecked with purple"_  
> — Adam of Bremen, 11th century

**The Sacred Law of Hospitality**  
Radegast embodied the ancient Slavic belief that any stranger might be a god in disguise. Those who welcomed travelers with generous hospitality earned his blessing of abundance and protection, while those who turned away guests risked his divine wrath. This sacred law made the Slavs renowned throughout medieval Europe for their exceptional hospitality.

**Lord of the Summer Solstice**  
As a solar deity, Radegast commanded the sun's power at its peak during the summer solstice. Farmers offered him sacrifices to ensure abundant harvests, while warriors sought his blessing for strength in battle. His divine fire was said to drive away the forces of darkness and winter's grip.

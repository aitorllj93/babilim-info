## Myths and Legends

**The Death of Baldr**  
In one of the most tragic tales of Norse mythology, Frigg sought to protect her beloved son Baldr from death by extracting oaths from every object in the world not to harm him. However, she overlooked the seemingly harmless mistletoe, which Loki used to orchestrate Baldr's death. Her attempts to retrieve her son from Hel's domain showcase both her power and the limits of maternal love against fate <mcreference link="https://mythology.net/norse/norse-gods/frigg/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The Winning of Wisdom**  
In the tale recorded in Grímnismál, Frigg demonstrated her cunning by outsmarting Odin in a wager over two kings, revealing her role as a clever and strategic deity who could match wits with the god of wisdom himself.

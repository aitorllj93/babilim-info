## Myths and Legends

**The Hunter's Transformation**  
One prominent myth tells of Eshmun as a young hunter of extraordinary beauty. When [[Astarte]] fell in love with him, he chose to mutilate himself rather than accept her advances. The goddess, moved by his suffering, restored him to life and transformed him into a god.

**The Healing Springs**  
Eshmun was associated with the discovery and guardianship of healing springs. His temple in Sidon was built over such springs, whose waters were believed to have curative properties.

**Divine Physician**  
As the divine healer, Eshmun taught humanity the arts of medicine and healing herbs. His knowledge was passed down through his priests, who served as both religious officials and physicians.

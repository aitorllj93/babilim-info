## Introduction

Kashyapa stands as one of the most venerated sages in Vedic tradition, revered as both a Saptarishi (one of the seven cosmic sages) and a Prajapati (progenitor of creation). <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashyapa" index="1">1</mcreference> This ancient rishi holds the unique distinction of being considered the progenitor of gods, demons, humans, and virtually all living beings in Hindu cosmology. <mcreference link="https://acharyaganesh.com/rishis/kashyapa" index="2">2</mcreference> His significance transcends mere mythology, embodying the cosmic principle of creation and the fundamental unity underlying the diversity of existence.

- **Language of origin**: Sanskrit, with Indo-European connections
- **Variants and evolution**: Related to Avestan *kasiiapa*, Sogdian *kyšph*, Kurdish *kûsî*, New Persian *kašaf*, *kaš(a)p*, all meaning "tortoise" <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashyapa" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Myths and Legends

**The Cosmic Progenitor**  
Kashyapa's most significant mythological role involves his marriages to the thirteen daughters of [[Daksha]] Prajapati. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kashyapa" index="1">1</mcreference> Through these unions, he became the father of diverse cosmic lineages: from Aditi came the Adityas (solar deities), from Diti came the Daityas (demons), from Kadru came the Nagas (serpents), from Vinata came [[Garuda]] and Aruna, and from Danu came the Danavas (another class of demons). <mcreference link="https://acharyaganesh.com/rishis/kashyapa" index="2">2</mcreference>

**The Draining of Kashmir**  
One significant legend describes how Kashyapa drained the stagnant waters of what would become the Kashmir valley, making it inhabitable for humanity. <mcreference link="https://acharyaganesh.com/rishis/kashyapa" index="2">2</mcreference> This myth symbolizes the transformation of chaos into order and the sage's role in preparing the world for conscious life.

> *"Kala created living things and first of all Prajapati, From Kala self-made Kasyapa, from Kala Holy Fire was born."*  
> — Atharvaveda XIX.53.10 <mcreference link="https://www.vyasaonline.com/encyclopedia/kashyapa/" index="3">3</mcreference>

**The Curse of Incarnation**  
According to some traditions, Kashyapa incarnated as Vasudeva, the father of [[Krishna]], due to a curse from [[Brahma]] after seeking Varuna's help for a yajna ritual. <mcreference link="https://van-helsing-own-story.fandom.com/wiki/Kashyapa" index="5">5</mcreference>

## Myths and Legends

**The Birth from the Cosmic Egg**  
In the beginning, [[Chronos]] and [[Ananke]] (or in some versions, [[Nyx]]) created the silver cosmic egg. From this egg burst forth Phanes, a radiant deity of light, equipped with golden wings and multiple animal heads. The emergence of Phanes brought the first light into existence, illuminating the cosmos for the first time.

**The First Order of Creation**  
After his birth, Phanes established himself as the first ruler of the gods, creating the sun, moon, and stars. He was both male and female, capable of creating life by himself. He created [[Nyx]] (Night) as his daughter and consort, and from their union came [[Gaia]] (Earth) and [[Uranus]] (Sky).

**The Passing of Power**  
Phanes established the divine succession by creating a golden scepter of rulership. He passed this scepter to [[Nyx]], who later gave it to her son [[Uranus]]. The scepter would continue to pass through divine generations until reaching [[Zeus]].

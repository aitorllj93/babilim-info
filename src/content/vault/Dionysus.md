## Introduction
Dionysus was the complex and multifaceted Greek god of wine, ecstasy, fertility, theater and religious frenzy. Born to Zeus and a mortal woman, his dual nature embodied both the joyous liberation of wine and its potentially destructive power. As a god who died and was reborn, he represented the eternal cycle of life, death, and resurrection <mcreference link="https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends-europe/dionysus-greek-god-0020145" index="2">2</mcreference>.

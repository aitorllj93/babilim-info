## Myths and Legends

**The Primordial Sacrifice**  
In the beginning, *Yemo and his twin brother *Manu were the first beings. *Manu became the first priest when he sacrificed *Yemo, dismembering his body to create the world. From different parts of *Yemo's body emerged the various elements of the cosmos and the social classes of human society.

**Legacy as First King**  
Before his sacrifice, *Yemo was regarded as the first king of the golden age, ruling over both humans and cattle. This aspect is particularly preserved in the Iranian tradition of Yima and the Hindu tradition of Yama.

## Myths and Legends

**The Creation of the World**  
After the slaying of [[Ymir]], Vili worked with his brothers [[Odin]] and [[Ve]] to create the world from the primordial giant's body. Together, they shaped the earth from Ymir's flesh, the seas from his blood, the mountains from his bones, and the heavens from his skull.

**The Creation of Humans**  
In one of their most significant acts, Vili and his brothers found two trees, Ask and Embla, on the shore. They transformed these trees into the first humans, with each brother granting different attributes. While Odin gave breath and life, and Vé gave speech and appearance, Vili bestowed will and understanding, giving humans the power of conscious thought and determination.

**The Divine Trinity**  
Vili formed part of a powerful divine trinity with his brothers, each representing different aspects of creation and consciousness. While Odin represented spirit and inspiration, and Vé represented sanctity and order, Vili embodied will and rational thought.

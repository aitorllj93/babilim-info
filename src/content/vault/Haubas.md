## Cultural Significance

Haubas was part of the rich pantheon of South Arabian deities that included other prominent gods such as [[Almaqah]], [[Athtar]], and [[Wadd]]. While Almaqah gained prominence as the national deity of the Sabaeans, Haubas maintained his significance as a lunar deity and oracular god.

The relationship between Haubas and other lunar deities in the region presents an interesting theological dynamic. The moon-god [[Sin]] appears in inscriptions from Shahwat, but according to historical sources, Haubas was specifically identified as the Sabaean moon-god.

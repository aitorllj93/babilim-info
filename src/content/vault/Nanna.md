## Introduction
Nanna was one of the most ancient and powerful deities in the Mesopotamian pantheon <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Nanna/" index="1">1</mcreference>. As the Sumerian god of the moon, wisdom, and time-keeping, he held supreme importance in the religious landscape, particularly in the city of Ur where his magnificent ziggurat stood as a testament to his divine authority. His influence extended from the very dawn of writing in Sumer (c. 3500 BCE) until the 3rd century CE.

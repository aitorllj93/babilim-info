## Myths and Legends

**Birth of Keening**  
When Brigid's son Ruadán was slain in battle, her grief gave birth to the Irish tradition of keening (ritual lament for the dead). Her mourning was so profound it united the warring tribes in peace, establishing her as a force for unity and reconciliation.

**The Sacred Flame**  
Brigid's eternal flame was tended by nineteen priestesses at her shrine in Kildare, with the goddess herself keeping the twentieth vigil. This flame continued burning through Christian times, tended by nuns who became its guardians.

**Goddess of Poetry**  
As the patroness of poets and bards, Brigid granted divine inspiration and protected those who sought to master the sacred arts of verse. Her blessing was considered essential for achieving mastery in poetry.

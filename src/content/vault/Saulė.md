## Myths and Legends

**The Daily Journey**  
Each morning, Saulė emerges from her golden palace in the east, riding her copper chariot drawn by fiery steeds across the sky. In the evening, she bathes her horses in the sea before descending to rest in her western palace. During winter, she travels a longer path, explaining the shorter days.

**The Celestial Wedding**  
One of the most significant myths involves Saulė's daughter's wedding to the moon god [[Mėnulis]]. The celebration brought together all the celestial deities, though the marriage later faced troubles due to Mėnulis's infidelity with [[Aušrinė]] (the morning star).

**The Weeping Sun**  
In Baltic folklore, there are numerous songs about Saulė weeping for the poor and orphaned, her tears falling as morning dew to nourish the earth. These tales emphasize her role as a maternal figure and protector of justice.

> "Where Saulė wept, there amber fell,
Where amber fell, the sea grew warm."
> — Lithuanian folk song

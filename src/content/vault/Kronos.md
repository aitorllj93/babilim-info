## Myths and Legends

**The Castration of Ouranos**  
[[Ouranos]], the sky god, imprisoned his children in [[Gaia]]'s womb. Gaia crafted a great adamantine sickle and urged her children to act against their father. Only Kronos was willing, and he used the sickle to castrate Ouranos, freeing his siblings and becoming the new ruler of the cosmos.

**Devouring of the Children**  
Warned by prophecy that his own child would overthrow him as he had overthrown his father, Kronos swallowed each of his children by [[Rhea]] at birth: [[Hestia]], [[Demeter]], [[Hera]], [[Hades]], and [[Poseidon]]. However, Rhea managed to save the youngest, [[Zeus]], by feeding Kronos a stone wrapped in swaddling clothes instead.

**The Titanomachy**  
Zeus, upon reaching adulthood, forced Kronos to disgorge his siblings and led a ten-year war against the Titans. The Olympians emerged victorious, with Kronos and most other Titans being imprisoned in Tartarus.

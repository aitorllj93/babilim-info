## Myths and Legends

**Birth and Early Life**  
Born to [[Kronos]] and [[Rhea]], Poseidon was swallowed by his father along with his siblings. After [[Zeus]] freed them, he joined the war against the Titans, ultimately receiving dominion over the seas in the division of the cosmos.

**Contest for Athens**  
Poseidon competed with [[Athena]] for patronage of Athens. He struck the Acropolis with his trident, creating a salt spring, but lost to Athena's gift of the olive tree. His anger was said to cause the flooding of the Attic plain.

**The Walls of Troy**  
Poseidon and [[Apollo]] built the walls of Troy for King Laomedon, who refused to pay them. In vengeance, Poseidon sent a sea monster to ravage Troy and later supported the Greeks in the Trojan War.

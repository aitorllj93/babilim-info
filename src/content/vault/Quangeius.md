## Myths and Legends

**Regional Worship**  
While specific myths have not survived, the pattern of worship reveals a deity deeply connected to local communities. The concentration of altars in the Portuguese inner Beira region, particularly around Star Mountain, suggests this was the heart of Quangeius's cult, from where it expanded to neighboring regions <mcreference link="https://goldentrail.wordpress.com/iberian-gods/quangeio/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**Cultural Expansion**  
The discovery of altars with different epithets (Tangus and Turicaecus) in regions south of the Tagus River indicates how local communities adapted and integrated Quangeius into their religious practices, suggesting a deity whose influence grew beyond its original territory <mcreference link="https://goldentrail.wordpress.com/iberian-gods/quangeio/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

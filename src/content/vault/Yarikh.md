## Myths and Legends

**The Courtship of Nikkal**  
The most famous myth involving Yarikh tells of his passionate pursuit of [[Nikkal]], the goddess of orchards. He offered her father [[Hirhibi]] (the summer god) multiple gifts including necklaces of lapis lazuli and pearls that shone like the moon, eventually winning her hand in marriage.

> "I shall send into her father's house silver without limit, gold will I send into her father's house, I shall send gems of lapis lazuli."

The marriage ceremony was overseen by the Kathirat, goddesses of marriage and childbirth, who blessed their union.

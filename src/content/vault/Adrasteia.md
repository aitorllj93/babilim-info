## Myths and Legends

**The Nurturing of Zeus**  
In her most famous myth, Adrasteia, along with her sister [[Ida]] and the [[Curetes]], was entrusted by [[Rhea]] with the care of the infant [[Zeus]]. They protected and nurtured him in a cave on Mount Ida to hide him from his father [[Kronos]], who was known for devouring his children. They fed Zeus on the milk of the goat [[Amalthea]] and gave him a magical toy ball that would later become a gift used by [[Aphrodite]] to bribe [[Eros]].

**Association with Nemesis**  
By the 5th century BC, Adrasteia became closely identified with [[Nemesis]], the goddess of divine retribution. In this aspect, she represented the inevitability of cosmic justice and the inescapable nature of divine punishment for hubris and wrongdoing.

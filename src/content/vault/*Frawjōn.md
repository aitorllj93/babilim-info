The evolution of *Frawjōn into later Germanic deities represents a complex theological development. The term began as an honorific title for women of high social standing before becoming deified in various forms across Germanic cultures.

Linguistic evidence shows that *Frawjōn was primarily a title meaning 'lady' or 'mistress', which eventually became personified as a divine figure. This process of deification led to the emergence of various goddess figures in different Germanic cultures, most notably:

- [[Freyja]] in Norse mythology

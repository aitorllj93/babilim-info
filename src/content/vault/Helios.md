## Introduction
Helios, the magnificent Titan god of the sun, embodied the very power of the life-giving solar orb. Each day, he would drive his golden chariot drawn by fire-breathing steeds across the sky, seeing all that occurred beneath his far-reaching rays. Though later somewhat eclipsed by [[Apollo]] in some roles, Helios remained a distinct and powerful deity, especially revered in places like Rhodes where his massive bronze Colossus stood as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

## Myths and Legends

**The Story of Phaethon**  
Perhaps the most famous myth involving Helios tells of his son [[Phaethon]], who begged to drive the sun chariot for a day. Despite Helios's warnings, the youth insisted, and Helios, bound by his oath on the River Styx, had to agree. Phaethon lost control of the horses, nearly burning the earth, until Zeus struck him down with a thunderbolt to prevent global catastrophe.

**Helios and Rhodes**  
Helios was particularly associated with the island of Rhodes, said to have raised it from the sea as his special domain. The Rhodians honored him with the Colossus of Rhodes, a massive bronze statue that became one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.

## Myths and Legends

**The Toothless God**  
A notable myth explains why Pusan has no teeth: he sacrificed them to help [[Indra]]. When [[Rudra]] was excluded from a divine sacrifice and attacked the gods in anger, Pusan's teeth were knocked out when he tried to eat his share of the offering. Since then, he can only eat porridge and soft foods, earning him the epithet "Karambhad" (porridge-eater).

**Guardian of Crossroads**  
Pusan is known for his perfect knowledge of all paths and roads. He guides not only travelers but also the sun through its daily journey and souls through their passage to the afterlife. His golden spear illuminates the way and wards off dangers.

**The Divine Herdsman**  
As a protector of cattle and finder of lost things, Pusan ensures that no livestock goes astray and helps recover missing possessions. He is often invoked by herders and travelers seeking his protection and guidance.

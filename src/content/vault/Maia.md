##  Introduction
Maia stands as a significant figure in both Greek and Roman mythology, embodying different but complementary aspects of divine motherhood and earthly abundance. In Greek tradition, she was the eldest and most beautiful of the [[Pleiades]], who bore [[Hermes]] to Zeus in the secluded caves of Mount Cyllene. In Roman religion, she evolved into a powerful earth goddess associated with springtime growth and warmth, giving her name to the month of May and becoming intertwined with several major goddesses of the Roman pantheon.

## Myths and Legends

**The Birth of Hermes/Mercury**  
In her Greek aspect, Maia dwelt alone in a cave on Mount Cyllene, avoiding the company of gods. Zeus visited her in secret at night, and she later bore [[Hermes]]. After giving birth, she wrapped the divine infant in blankets, but the precocious god soon slipped away to begin his famous cattle-theft adventure with [[Apollo]].

**Nurturing of Arcas**  
Maia also played a crucial role in raising [[Arcas]], the son of [[Callisto]] and Zeus. After Hera transformed Callisto into a bear out of jealousy, Maia took in the infant Arcas, who would later become the eponymous hero of Arcadia.

**Roman Traditions**  
In Roman mythology, Maia became associated with [[Vulcan]] and the concept of generative warmth. Her festival on the Kalends of May featured the sacrifice of a pregnant sow, symbolizing fertility and growth. Through her son Mercury, she was connected to the [[Lares]], the guardian spirits of Rome, as Mercury was said to be their father.

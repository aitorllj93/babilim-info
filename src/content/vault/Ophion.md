## Myths and Legends

**The First Rulers of Olympus**

According to Orphic tradition, as recorded in Apollonius Rhodius' Argonautica, Ophion and [[Eurynome]] were the first rulers of Olympus. Together they danced upon the primordial waves, bringing order to the cosmos <mcreference link="https://gods-and-demons.fandom.com/wiki/Ophion" index="3">3</mcreference>.

> _"He sang how first of all Ophion and Eurynome, daughter of Oceanus, held the sway of snowy Olympus"_
> — Apollonius Rhodius, Argonautica

**The Fall from Power**

Their reign was challenged by the Titans [[Kronos]] and [[Rhea]], who overthrew them in combat. Using a chain forged by [[Okeanos]], Kronos defeated Ophion, and both he and Eurynome were cast into the waters of Oceanus <mcreference link="https://timelessmyths.com/classical/pantheon/primeval-deities/ophion" index="4">4</mcreference>.

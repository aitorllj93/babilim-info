## Myths and Legends

**The Death of Dumuzi**
In the myth of [[Dumuzi]]'s death, Geshtinanna plays a crucial role as both sister and protector. When demons pursue her brother, she refuses to reveal his hiding place despite brutal torture. Her loyalty and devotion to [[Dumuzi]] exemplify the deep bonds of divine siblinghood.

**The Alternating Seasons**
After [[Inanna]]'s descent to the underworld and [[Dumuzi]]'s subsequent death, Geshtinanna agrees to spend half the year in the underworld in her brother's place. This alternation creates the cycle of seasons, with her time below corresponding to the barren winter months.

**The Divine Scribe**
As the chief scribe of the underworld (dubsar-mah aralike), Geshtinanna maintains the records of the dead and controls their entrance into the afterlife. Her wisdom and skill with tablets make her indispensable to the administration of the afterlife.

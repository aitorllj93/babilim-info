## Myths and Legends

**Creation of Humanity**  
Enki, along with the mother goddess [[Ninmah]], created humans from clay to serve the gods. Unlike other deities, he consistently acted as humanity's protector and benefactor.

**The ME and Civilization**  
Enki was the guardian of the ME, the divine decrees that formed the basis of civilization. In one famous myth, [[Inanna]] tricks him into giving her the ME, thus transferring many aspects of culture to her city of Uruk.

**The Great Flood**  
In the Sumerian flood myth, Enki warned Ziusudra (known later as [[Utnapishtim]]) about the coming deluge, providing instructions for building a boat to preserve life on Earth.

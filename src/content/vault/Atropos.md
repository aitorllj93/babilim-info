## Myths and Legends

**The Three Fates**  
Atropos works in concert with her sisters [[Clotho]] and [[Lachesis]]. While [[Clotho]] spins the thread of life and [[Lachesis]] measures it, Atropos makes the final, irrevocable cut that ends a mortal's life <mcreference link="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Atropos-Greek-mythology" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Relationship with Zeus**  
Though even [[Zeus]] typically respects the Moirai's decisions, there are myths suggesting he occasionally intervenes in their workings, particularly in cases of heroes or his own offspring <mcreference link="https://www.greekmythology.com/Other_Gods/The_Fates/the_fates.html" index="3">3</mcreference>.

## Introduction

Kataḫzipuri was a powerful goddess worshiped by the Hattians, Hittites, and Palaians in Bronze Age Anatolia. She was the divine mistress of magic, wielding both healing and potentially dangerous supernatural powers. As a goddess who "saw from heaven," she was commonly invoked in rituals dealing with healing, purification, and the resolution of spiritual crises. Her prominence in the pantheon made her one of the most frequently mentioned deities in Hittite religious texts.

## Etymology

- **Root meaning** of the name: Disputed origins with two main interpretations
- **Language of origin**: Hattic
- **Variants and evolution**: Kataḫzipuri and Kataḫziwuri are both attested forms
- **Symbolic or metaphoric implications**: Possibly "evil under the land" suggesting her power to consign problems to the underworld

> _Gabrielle Frantz-Szabó assumes it is derived from the words kattaḫ, "queen", and pur, "land". Oğuz Soysal disagrees with this interpretation and speculatively suggests that it might mean "evil under the land", though he stresses this would not indicate she was viewed as malevolent, but rather that certain types of problems could be entrusted to her so that through her intervention they can metaphorically remain "under the land"._

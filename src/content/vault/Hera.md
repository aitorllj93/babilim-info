## Introduction
Hera reigned as the Queen of the Greek gods, wife of Zeus, and guardian of marriage, childbirth, and family bonds. Her divine authority extended over some of the most fundamental aspects of Greek society, though she was equally renowned for her fierce temperament and relentless pursuit of justice, particularly against Zeus's numerous infidelities.

## Myths and Legends

**Marriage to Zeus**  
After Zeus seduced her in the form of a distressed cuckoo bird, Hera became his wife and queen. Their marriage was celebrated as the perfect divine union, though it was frequently troubled by Zeus's infidelities.

**The Birth of [[Hephaestus]]**  
In some versions of the myth, Hera bore Hephaestus parthenogenetically in response to Zeus's sole creation of Athena. When she saw her son's imperfect form, she cast him from Olympus, an act that would have later consequences.

**Persecution of [[Heracles]]**  
Perhaps her most famous vendetta was against Heracles, Zeus's son by Alcmene. She sent serpents to kill him as an infant, later imposed the Twelve Labors through Eurystheus, and consistently tried to thwart his success.

**The Judgment of Paris**  
When Paris chose Aphrodite over Hera in the contest of beauty, offering her the golden apple, Hera's wounded pride contributed to the events leading to the Trojan War.

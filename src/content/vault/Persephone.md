## Myths and Legends

**The Abduction by Hades**  
While gathering flowers with her companions, Persephone was abducted by [[Hades]], who had been struck by Eros's arrow. Her mother [[Demeter]]'s grief caused all vegetation to die, forcing [[Zeus]] to intervene. Because Persephone had eaten pomegranate seeds in the underworld, she was bound to spend part of each year there, creating the cycle of seasons.

**Queen of the Underworld**  
As Hades's queen, Persephone grew into a powerful and formidable deity. She presided over the judgments of dead souls and had authority over ghosts and demons. Her presence transformed the underworld, bringing a measure of light and mercy to the realm of the dead.

**The Eleusinian Mysteries**  
Persephone played a central role in the Eleusinian Mysteries alongside her mother [[Demeter]]. Her annual descent and return symbolized death and rebirth, offering initiates hope for a blessed afterlife.

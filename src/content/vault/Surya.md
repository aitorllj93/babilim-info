## Myths and Legends

**The Birth of Surya**  
Born as one of the Adityas (children of Aditi), Surya emerged as the most radiant of the celestial deities. His light was so intense that even the gods couldn't bear it, leading [[Vishvakarma]] to reduce his brilliance.

**Marriage to Sanjna**  
Surya's marriage to Sanjna (Consciousness) produced several children, including Manu (progenitor of humanity), Yama (god of death), and Yami. Unable to bear his radiance, Sanjna created a shadow-self (Chhaya) to take her place while she performed austerities.

**Other Notable Tales**:
- His role in the birth of [[Karna]]
- The story of Hanuman's childhood attempt to swallow the sun
- His healing of Samba, Krishna's son

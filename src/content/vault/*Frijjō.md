## Introduction

As the most prominent female member of the *Ansiwiz (gods), she embodied love, marriage, and divine authority.

## Historical Development

The evolution of *Frijjō into later Germanic deities represents a complex theological development. Scholars debate whether she later split into two distinct goddesses or if her various aspects were emphasized differently in different regions:

- In Scandinavia: Developed into both [[Frigg]] (sovereignty, prophecy) and possibly [[Freyja]] (love, magic)
- In Continental Germanic areas: Preserved as [[Frīja]]/[[Frea]] with combined attributes

Linguistic evidence suggests that the original goddess carried both the epithet *frijjō ("beloved") and possibly *frawjō ("lady"), which may explain the later development into separate deities in some traditions.

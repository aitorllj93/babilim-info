## Myths and Legends

**The Loss of Proserpina**  
The central myth of Ceres mirrors that of Demeter, telling of the loss of her daughter [[Proserpina]] to [[Pluto]] (Roman Hades). In her grief, Ceres wandered the earth, neglecting her duties and causing worldwide famine. Jupiter (Zeus) eventually negotiated Proserpina's partial return, establishing the cycle of seasons.

**The Plebeian Protector**  
Ceres held special significance for Rome's plebeians, protecting their civil and political rights. Her temple on the Aventine Hill served as a repository for plebeian records and a center for plebeian justice.

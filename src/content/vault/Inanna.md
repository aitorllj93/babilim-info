## Myths and Legends

**The Descent to the Underworld**  
Inanna's most famous myth describes her journey to the underworld to challenge her sister [[Ereshkigal]]. At each of the seven gates, she is stripped of her divine powers and regalia, ultimately facing death. Through the intervention of [[Enki]] and the mourning of [[Dumuzi]], she is restored to life, establishing the cycle of seasonal death and rebirth.

**Acquisition of the Me**  
Inanna obtains the divine powers (me) from [[Enki]] through clever manipulation, bringing civilization's gifts to her city of Uruk. This establishes her authority over all aspects of civilized life.

**The Sacred Marriage**  
The ritual marriage between Inanna and [[Dumuzi]] was celebrated annually, with the high priestess and king reenacting their union to ensure fertility and abundance for the land.

**Courtship of Dumuzi**  
The love story between Inanna and the shepherd [[Dumuzi]] represents the union of divine and earthly power, though it ends tragically with his periodic confinement to the underworld.

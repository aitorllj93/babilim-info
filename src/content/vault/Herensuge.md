## Myths and Legends

**The Legend of Teodosio de Goñi**
The most famous Herensuge tale involves a Navarrese knight named Teodosio de Goñi. While doing penance for parricide in the Aralar Range, he encounters a woman held captive by the dragon. In his attempt to rescue her, the dragon bites through his chains. When all seems lost, Saint Michael, with God's blessing, appears and decapitates the dragon, freeing both Teodosio and the woman <mcreference link="https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Herensuge" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The Seven Heads Legend**
According to some traditions, the seven heads were actually offspring that would mature and eventually fall off to wreak havoc independently. When the seventh head formed, the Herensuge would burst into flames and fly westward to Itxasgorrieta ("the place of red seas"), where it would sink into the waters <mcreference link="https://buber.net/Basque/2024/05/26/basque-fact-of-the-week-herensuge-the-basque-dragon/" index="4">4</mcreference>.

**The Princess and the Dragon**
In another tale, a kingdom is forced to regularly sacrifice people to the Herensuge. When the king's daughter is chosen, a brave hero (sometimes with the help of magical items or allies) confronts and defeats the seven-headed dragon, winning the princess's hand in marriage <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herensuge" index="1">1</mcreference>.

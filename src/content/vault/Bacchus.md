## Introduction
Bacchus was the Roman god of wine-making, vegetation, fertility, festivity, and religious ecstasy. As a divine liberator, he brought joy and creative freedom to his followers through the sacred gift of wine, while also wielding the power to punish those who opposed his worship with divine madness.

## Etymology
- **Root meaning**: The name 'Bacchus' derives from the Greek word 'Bakkhos', related to 'bakkheia' meaning a state of divine ecstasy and frenzy
- **Language of origin**: Greek, later adopted by Romans
- **Variants and evolution**: Also known as Liber Pater ("Free Father") in Roman culture

## Cultural Context
- **Civilization**: Roman Empire, with Greek origins
- **Geographic Region**: Mediterranean Basin, particularly Rome and its colonies
- **Historical Period**: Worship established by 7th century BCE, continuing through Roman Empire
- **Alternative Names**:
  - Liber Pater – Roman name emphasizing freedom and fertility
  - Eleutherios – "The Liberator" in Greek context

## Myths and Legends

**The Double Birth**
Bacchus experienced two births - first as the son of Jupiter and Proserpina, and later reborn to Jupiter and the mortal Semele. After Semele was consumed by Jupiter's divine form, he saved the unborn child by sewing him into his thigh until ready to be born again.

**The Indian Conquest**
A significant myth tells of Bacchus' triumphant return from conquering India, depicted in ritual processions with his chariot drawn by tigers, surrounded by maenads, satyrs, and revelers.

## Worship and Rituals

The primary form of Bacchus worship was the Bacchanalia, mysterious festivals characterized by ecstatic rituals and uninhibited revelry. These celebrations included:
- Ritual sacrifice of animals (particularly goats)
- Masked dances and dramatic performances
- Sacred consumption of wine and bread
- Religious processions

The Roman state eventually restricted these celebrations due to their subversive nature, requiring Senate approval and limiting participants. The festivals were later merged with the more respectable Liberalia to maintain some form of worship while controlling its wilder aspects.

## Later Influence

Bacchus' influence extended well beyond the fall of Rome. Even three centuries after Christianity became the official religion, the 692 Quinisext Council had to specifically prohibit various Bacchic practices, including:
- The Brumalia festival
- Public dances of women
- Ritual cross-dressing
- Wearing of Dionysiac masks
- Invocation of Bacchus during wine-making

## Modern Interpretations

Bacchus continues to symbolize the liberating and creative powers of wine, as well as the tension between social order and ecstatic freedom. His legacy lives on in art, literature, and the enduring human desire for occasional escape from everyday constraints through controlled revelry.

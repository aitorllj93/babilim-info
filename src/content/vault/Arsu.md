## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Twins**
Arsu and his twin brother [[Azizos]] were venerated as the divine personifications of the evening and morning star. While Arsu guided travelers through the evening hours upon his camel, his brother heralded the dawn on horseback. Their complementary roles reflected the dual appearance of Venus in the sky.

A significant artifact from the Temple of Adonis in Dura-Europos depicts Arsu mounted on a camel, with an inscription by the sculptor Oga dedicating the relief "to Arsu the camel-rider, for the life of his son." This representation emphasizes his role as a protective deity for desert travelers.

Anu, also known as Anann, is one of the most ancient Irish goddesses, particularly associated with the province of Munster. Often identified with [[Danu]], she represents the primordial maternal force in Irish mythology. Her presence is eternally marked in the landscape through the Paps of Anu (Dá Chích Anann), two breast-shaped mountains in County Kerry that stand as testament to her role as the land's nurturing mother.

## Myths and Legends

**The Shaping of the Land**  
According to tradition, the Paps of Anu (Dá Chích Anann) were formed from the goddess's breasts, creating sacred mountains that would nurture and sustain the people of Munster. These twin peaks became important ritual sites, marked with prehistoric cairns at their summits.

**The Great Mother**  
As one of Ireland's great mother goddesses, Anu was said to nurture and protect the land and its people. She was particularly associated with cattle and abundance, reflecting her role in ensuring the fertility and prosperity of the land.

**Connection to the Tuatha Dé Danann**  
Though often identified with [[Danu]], mother of the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]], Anu's worship appears to have been more localized to Munster, where she was revered as a territorial goddess and protector of the land.

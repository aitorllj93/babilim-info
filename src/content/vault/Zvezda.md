## Myths and Legends

**The Gatekeeper of Dawn**  
Zvezda serves as the celestial gatekeeper who opens the gates of [[Dazhbog]]'s palace each morning, allowing the sun god to begin his journey across the sky. <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorya" index="1">1</mcreference> Her light precedes the dawn, preparing the world for the gift of sunlight and warmth.

**Sister of the Zorya**  
In many traditions, Zvezda is considered a sister or aspect of the [[Zorya]] goddesses, particularly Zorya Utrennyaya (the Morning Zorya). <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zorya" index="1">1</mcreference> Together, they maintain the cosmic order of day and night, ensuring the sun's safe passage through the heavens.

**Guardian Against Darkness**  
Zvezda's light serves as protection against the forces of darkness and evil, offering hope to those who face the uncertainties of night. Her appearance in the pre-dawn sky signals that light will always triumph over darkness.

## Myths and Legends

**Pre-Islamic Worship**
In pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah-Taala was acknowledged as the supreme creator deity, though worshipped alongside other deities. Arab pagans would invoke Allah-Taala's name during pilgrimages to the Kaaba, recognizing him as the creator god while also paying homage to other deities considered his daughters or associates.

**Transition to Monotheism**
The transformation of Allah-Taala's worship from a supreme deity among many to the One God of Islam represents one of the most significant theological developments in Arabian religious history. This shift maintained the deity's creative and supreme aspects while establishing absolute monotheism.

## Myths and Legends

**The Second Battle of Mag Tuired**
Badb plays a crucial role in the battle between the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and the [[Fomorians]]. She, along with her sisters [[Macha]] and [[Nemain]], spreads confusion among the Fomorian armies through magic and terrifying cries. After the battle, she prophesies both peace and doom, foretelling the end of the world.

**The Death of Cú Chulainn**
In the death tale of [[Cú Chulainn]], Badb appears as a harbinger of his doom. She perches on his shoulder in crow form after he falls in battle, signifying that the great hero has truly died.

**The Washer at the Ford**
Like her sister-aspect [[Morrigan]], Badb sometimes appears as a washer at the ford, cleaning the bloody clothes of those about to die in battle. Her presence in this form is one of the most dreaded omens in Celtic mythology.

## Introduction

Pṛthvī Mātā (Sanskrit: पृथ्वी मातृ), known as "Mother Earth" or "The Vast One," stands as one of the most ancient and revered deities in Vedic religion and Hindu mythology. As the divine personification of the Earth itself, she embodies the nurturing, life-sustaining, and protective qualities of our planet. Pṛthvī represents not merely the physical earth beneath our feet, but the cosmic principle of fertility, stability, and maternal care that enables all existence to flourish. Her worship dates back to the earliest Vedic hymns, making her one of humanity's oldest recognized divine mothers.

## Myths and Legends

**The Cosmic Parents: Union with Dyaus**  
In the Ṛgveda, Pṛthvī is most often paired with [[Dyaus]], the sky father, forming the primordial divine couple Dyāvāpṛthivī. This sacred union represents the fundamental duality of earth and sky that creates and sustains all life. Together, they are described as the universal parents who give birth to the gods and all existence, with Dyaus fertilizing Pṛthvī through rain, enabling life to flourish.

**The Tale of King Prithu and the Earth Cow**  
A famous Puranic myth tells of the tyrannical King Vena, whose misrule caused Pṛthvī to withdraw her fertility, leading to famine. When the righteous Prince [[Prithu]] emerged, he pursued Pṛthvī, who had taken the form of a cow to hide her bounty. Through his determination and divine righteousness, Prithu convinced her to restore agricultural abundance, leading to his name being connected to the earth itself.

> _"She is the stable, fertile, and benevolent presence who provides sustenance to all beings living on her vast, firm expanse"_  
> — Vedic descriptions of Pṛthvī

**The Prithvi Sukta**  
The most extensive hymn dedicated to Pṛthvī appears in the Atharvaveda (12.1), where she is praised as an independent and powerful goddess, unlike her paired appearances in the Ṛgveda.

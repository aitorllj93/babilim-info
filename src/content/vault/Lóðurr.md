## Myths and Legends

**The Creation of Humans**
The most significant myth involving Lóðurr tells of how he, along with [[Odin]] and [[Hœnir]], discovered two tree trunks, Ask and Embla, on the shore. Together, the three gods transformed these lifeless forms into the first humans. While Odin gave them breath and spirit, and Hœnir provided reason and motion, Lóðurr's gift was vital warmth, blood, and good appearance.

**The Mysterious Absence**
After his role in creation, Lóðurr largely disappears from Norse mythology, leading to much scholarly speculation about his true identity and fate. Some theories suggest he might be another form of [[Loki]], while others maintain he was a distinct deity whose other myths have been lost to time.

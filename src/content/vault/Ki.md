Through her union with [[An]], Ki gave birth to the first generation of gods, including:
- [[Enlil]] (god of air and wind)
- [[Enki]] (god of water and wisdom)
- The [[Anunnaki]] (the great gods)

As the earth mother, Ki was instrumental in the creation of all earthly life, providing the material substance from which humans and animals were formed.

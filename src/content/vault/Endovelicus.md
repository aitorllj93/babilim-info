## Introduction
Endovelicus was one of the most significant pre-Roman deities of the Lusitanian pantheon, revered as a powerful god of healing, prophecy, and the underworld. His influence was so profound that his worship continued well into the Roman period, making him one of the few indigenous Iberian deities to be embraced by the Romans themselves.

## Myths and Legends

**The Oracle of the Deep**
Endovelicus was believed to deliver prophecies through dreams and underground vapors, similar to the Oracle of Delphi. Worshippers would practice incubatio (ritual sleep) at his sanctuaries, seeking divine guidance through their dreams.

> *"EX IMPERATO AVERNO"*
> — Ancient inscription meaning "by the determination that emanated from below"

**Sacred Sites**
The most prominent sanctuary of Endovelicus was located at São Miguel da Mota in Alentejo, Portugal. The site was so significant that it continued as a sacred place through multiple religious transitions - from Lusitanian to Roman, then Alanic, Muslim, and finally Christian worship.

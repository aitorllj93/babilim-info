## Myths and Legends

**Primordial Origins**
In Proto-Germanic mythology, *Yum(i)yaz emerged as the first being, preceding even the gods themselves. This concept is preserved in the later Norse myth of [[Ymir]], who arose from the interaction of primordial ice and heat in the void of Ginnungagap.

**Cosmic Sacrifice**
The central myth involving *Yum(i)yaz revolves around his cosmic sacrifice and dismemberment, a theme that persisted in Norse mythology with [[Ymir]]'s death at the hands of [[Odin]] and his brothers. This sacrificial act represents the transformation of chaos into cosmic order.

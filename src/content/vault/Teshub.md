## Myths and Legends

**The Song of Emergence**
Teshub's birth was extraordinary - he emerged from the split skull of [[Kumarbi]] after the latter had bitten off the genitals of [[An|Anu]] during a struggle for divine kingship <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teshub" index="3">3</mcreference>. This violent emergence marked the beginning of a new divine order.

**The Song of Ullikummi**
One of the most famous myths describes Teshub's battle against Ullikummi, a stone giant created by [[Kumarbi]] to overthrow him. Despite the monster's immense power, Teshub eventually triumphed with the help of [[Ea]] and an ancient copper cutting tool <mcreference link="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Teshub" index="1">1</mcreference>.

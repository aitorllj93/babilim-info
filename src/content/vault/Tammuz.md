## Myths and Legends

**The Death of Dumuzi**  
The central myth involves his relationship with [[Inanna]]/[[Ishtar]]. When Inanna descends to the underworld and is killed by [[Ereshkigal]], she is allowed to return only if she provides a replacement. She chooses Dumuzi, who had not mourned her death. He is pursued by demons but is eventually allowed to split his time between the underworld and earth, creating the cycle of seasons.

**The Sacred Marriage**  
Tammuz was the divine consort in the sacred marriage ritual with [[Inanna]], performed annually to ensure fertility and abundance. This union was re-enacted by the king and high priestess, symbolizing the marriage between heaven and earth.

**The Shepherd's Death**  
Various versions of his death exist, including:
- Killed by demons sent by [[Inanna]]
- Torn apart by wild animals
- Drowned in a flash flood

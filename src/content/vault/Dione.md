## Introduction
Dione was a powerful Titaness in Greek mythology, most prominently known as the oracle goddess of Dodona, where she shared the oldest sanctuary in Greece with [[Zeus]]. As Zeus's early consort and the mother of [[Aphrodite]], she represents an ancient divine feminine presence whose worship predates many Olympian traditions. Her position at Dodona, where priestesses interpreted the whispers of sacred oaks, marked her as a keeper of primordial wisdom.

## Myths and Legends

**The Oracle of Dodona**  
Dione presided over the oldest oracle in Greece alongside [[Zeus]]. According to Herodotus, two black doves flew from Thebes in Egypt – one to Libya to establish the oracle of [[Ammon]], and one to Dodona to establish her oracle. The priests interpreted the rustling of sacred oak leaves and the murmuring of springs to deliver prophecies.

**Mother of Aphrodite**  
In Homer's tradition, Dione was the mother of [[Aphrodite]] by [[Zeus]]. When Aphrodite was wounded by the mortal hero Diomedes during the Trojan War, she fled to her mother Dione on Mount Olympus, who consoled and healed her daughter while recounting tales of other gods who had suffered at mortal hands.

**The Titaness Heritage**  
As a Titaness, Dione was either daughter of [[Ouranos]] and [[Gaia]], or of [[Oceanus]] and [[Tethys]], placing her among the ancient generation of deities that preceded the Olympians. Her enduring presence at Dodona suggests she was a pre-Hellenic goddess who was later incorporated into the Greek pantheon.

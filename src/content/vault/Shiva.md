## Myths and Legends

**The Cosmic Dance**
As Nataraja, Shiva performs the Tandava, the cosmic dance that creates, maintains, and dissolves the universe. Each gesture in this dance symbolizes a cosmic function, from creation to destruction, demonstrating Shiva's supreme power over existence itself.

**The Blue-Throated One**
During the churning of the cosmic ocean, when deadly poison threatened all existence, Shiva consumed the poison to save the universe. Rather than swallowing it, he held it in his throat, which turned blue, earning him the name Nilakantha (Blue-throated One).

**Marriage to Parvati**
After the self-immolation of his first wife [[Sati]], Shiva retreated into deep meditation. [[Parvati]], Sati's reincarnation, performed severe penances to win his love. Their divine union represents the perfect balance of masculine and feminine energies.

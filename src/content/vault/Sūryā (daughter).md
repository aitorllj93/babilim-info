## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Wedding**  
The most famous myth concerning Sūryā is her wedding, detailed in the Rigveda's wedding hymn (RV 10.85). The Ashvins, divine twins, came as suitors on behalf of Soma. Her father, the Sun god, and the other deities consented to the match <mcreference link="https://kalpya.com/2020/12/12/marriage-rig-veda/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The Celestial Journey**  
Her wedding journey is described in cosmic terms:

> "Mind was her vehicle; the heaven was her covering;
The two bright ones were the oxen, when Sūryā went to her new home"

This cosmic imagery became the template for earthly wedding ceremonies.

**Divine Courtship**  
Multiple deities sought Sūryā's hand, including the Ashvins and Soma. The myth speaks of a divine race where the first to reach the sun would win her hand. The Ashvins emerged victorious, though in some versions she is also associated with Soma <mcreference link="https://www.wisdomlib.org/hinduism/essay/women-in-the-atharva-veda-samhita/d/doc1146273.html" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Death of Baldr**  
The most famous myth concerning Baldr tells of his death. After being troubled by dreams of his own demise, his mother [[Frigg]] extracted oaths from everything in creation not to harm him. However, she overlooked the seemingly harmless mistletoe. The jealous god [[Loki]] discovered this oversight and crafted a dart from mistletoe, which he gave to Baldr's blind brother [[Höðr]]. While the gods were amusing themselves by throwing objects at the invulnerable Baldr, Höðr unknowingly threw the fatal mistletoe dart, guided by Loki's hand.

> _"And Baldr fell dead to the ground, and that was the greatest misfortune that has ever occurred among gods and men."_
> — Prose Edda

**The Failed Resurrection**  
After Baldr's death, [[Hermóðr]] rode to [[Hel]]'s realm to plead for his return. Hel agreed to release Baldr if everything in creation would weep for him. All did, except for one giantess (believed to be Loki in disguise), thus keeping Baldr in the realm of the dead until Ragnarök.

**The Funeral Ship**  
Baldr's funeral was one of the most magnificent events in Norse mythology. His body was placed upon his great ship Hringhorni, along with his wife [[Nanna]], who had died of grief. The ship was set aflame and pushed out to sea by the giantess Hyrrokkin.

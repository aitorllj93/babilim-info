## Introduction
Dis Pater was one of the most significant deities in Roman religion, serving as both the ruler of the underworld and the master of subterranean wealth. His name, meaning "wealthy father" or "rich father," reflects his dual nature as both a chthonic deity and a god of abundance. Unlike his Greek counterpart [[Hades]], Dis Pater's origin is distinctly Roman, though he later became syncretized with various underworld deities.

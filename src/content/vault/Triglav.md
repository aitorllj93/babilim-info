## Myths and Legends

**The Sacred Horse of Szczecin**  
In Szczecin's temple, Triglav's priests maintained a sacred black horse used for divination. Before important battles or journeys, they would lay spears on the ground and lead the horse between them. If the horse, guided by Triglav's will, passed without touching any spear, it was considered a favorable omen <mcreference link="https://brendan-noble.com/triglav-trzyglow-slavic-three-headed-god-slavic-mythology-saturday/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Hidden Idol**  
When Bishop Otto of Bamberg came to destroy the temples in 1127, the priests of Wolin smuggled away Triglav's golden idol, entrusting it to a widow who hid it within a hollow oak tree. The idol could only be accessed through a small opening used for offerings, preserving the god's presence despite the Christian conversion <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglav_(mythology)" index="1">1</mcreference>.

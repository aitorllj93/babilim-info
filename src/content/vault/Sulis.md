## Introduction
Sulis, the powerful Celtic goddess of healing waters and thermal springs, held sovereignty over the sacred hot springs at Bath (Aquae Sulis) in Britain. Venerated as both a life-giving mother goddess and an agent of justice through curses, she exemplifies the Celtic understanding of sacred waters as sources of both healing and power. Her significance is evidenced by the Romans' unusual deference in placing her name before Minerva's in the syncretic form Sulis Minerva, marking her as one of the few Celtic goddesses to maintain her prominence under Roman rule.

## Myths and Legends

**The Sacred Springs of Bath**  
The mythology of Sulis is deeply rooted in the natural phenomenon of Britain's only hot springs, where her powerful presence was believed to both heal the sick and punish wrongdoers. The springs, producing over half a million gallons of hot water daily, were seen as direct manifestations of her divine power.

**Divine Justice through Curse Tablets**  
The most extensive evidence of Sulis's cult comes through the curse tablets (defixiones) found in her sacred spring. These tablets reveal a goddess who was deeply involved in human justice, called upon to right wrongs and punish thieves.

> _"Docimedis has lost two gloves and asks that the thief responsible should lose their minds and eyes in the goddess' temple"_  
> — Bath curse tablet

## Myths and Legends

**The Kingship in Heaven**
The most famous myth involving Kumarbi is the "Song of Kumarbi" or "Kingship in Heaven." This narrative begins with Alalu as the king of heaven, who rules for nine years before being overthrown by Anu. Kumarbi then defeats Anu, but in a shocking twist, bites off and swallows Anu's genitals. This act results in Kumarbi becoming pregnant with several deities, including Teshub, who would later become his greatest adversary <mcreference link="https://brickthology.com/2020/07/26/kumarbi/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Song of Ullikummi**
After losing his throne to Teshub, Kumarbi creates a stone giant named Ullikummi to challenge the new king of heaven. The giant grows to enormous proportions, threatening the cosmic order, but is eventually defeated through the intervention of the god Ea and the use of an ancient copper cutting tool <mcreference link="https://www.folklore.earth/culture/hurrian/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

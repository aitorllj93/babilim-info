## Introduction
Hœnir is one of the most intriguing figures in Norse mythology, known primarily for his role as one of the three creator gods who gave life to the first humans. Together with [[Odin]] and [[Lóðurr]], he bestowed crucial gifts upon Ask and Embla, transforming them from lifeless tree trunks into the first human beings. Despite his significant role in creation, Hœnir remains one of the more mysterious Aesir gods.

## Myths and Legends

**The Creation of Humans**
In the primary myth involving Hœnir, he worked alongside [[Odin]] and [[Lóðurr]] to create the first humans from two tree trunks found on the seashore. While Odin gave them breath and spirit, Hœnir's gift was óðr (mind, thought, or sense), and Lóðurr provided warmth and good appearance.

**The Hostage Exchange**
After the Æsir-Vanir War, Hœnir was sent to the [[Vanir]] as a hostage along with [[Mímir]]. The Vanir made him a chieftain, but discovered that he would only give decisions when Mimir was present, always deferring to the phrase "Let others decide" when alone. This led to tension and ultimately the decapitation of Mimir.

**The Survival of Ragnarök**
According to the Völuspá, Hœnir is one of the few gods who survives [[Ragnarök]], the twilight of the gods, and is destined to read the sacred lots or prophecies in the renewed world.

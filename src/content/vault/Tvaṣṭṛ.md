This divine implement proved crucial in Indra's battles against cosmic forces of chaos.

**The Creation of Vritra**
After [[Indra]] killed Tvaṣṭṛ's son [[Vishvarupa]], Tvaṣṭṛ sought revenge by creating the powerful demon [[Vritra]]. However, a mispronunciation in his incantation ultimately allowed Indra to defeat his creation.

As the guardian of Soma, Tvaṣṭṛ had a complex relationship with [[Indra]], who repeatedly stole the divine drink. This conflict exemplifies the tension between divine craftsman and warrior deities.

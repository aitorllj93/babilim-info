## Myths and Legends

**Arrival at Tara**  
When Lugh first arrived at Tara, he was challenged to prove his worth to enter. He declared mastery of every skill the guards named - smith, champion, swordsman, historian, hero, poet, sorcerer, physician, cupbearer, and craftsman. Only by claiming mastery of all these arts at once was he admitted, as no other god possessed such versatility.

**The Death of Balor**  
In one of his most famous myths, Lugh led the Tuatha Dé Danann against the Fomorians. He fulfilled a prophecy by killing his grandfather, the mighty [[Balor]] of the Evil Eye, using his sling to drive Balor's deadly eye through the back of his head, turning its destructive power against the Fomorian army.

**The Founding of Lughnasadh**  
Lugh established the festival of Lughnasadh in honor of his foster-mother, [[Tailtiu]], who died clearing Ireland's plains for agriculture. The festival marks the beginning of the harvest season and traditionally featured contests of skill and athletic games.

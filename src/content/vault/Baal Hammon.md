**Rise to Supreme Power**
Baal Hammon's supremacy among the Carthaginian gods is believed to date to the fifth century BC, following the severance of relations between Carthage and Tyre after the Battle of Himera (480 BC). He was especially worshipped as Ba øal Qarnaim (Lord of Two Horns) at an open-air sanctuary on Jebel Boukornine ("the two-horned hill") across the bay from Carthage, connecting his worship to the natural landscape.

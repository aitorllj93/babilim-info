## Introduction
An (later known as Anu) was the supreme god of the Mesopotamian pantheon, the personification of the heavens and the progenitor of all the gods. As one of the oldest deities in human history, his worship dates back to the earliest Sumerian periods, where he was revered as the ultimate source of all divine authority and cosmic order.

## Myths and Legends

**The Separation of Heaven and Earth**  
In the primordial times, An (Heaven) and [[Ki]] (Earth) were united. Their separation created the world as we know it, with An becoming the dome of heaven and Ki forming the earth below.

**The Creation of the Gods**  
With [[Ki]], An fathered the first generation of gods, including [[Enlil]], who would later become the active ruler of the gods, and [[Enki]], the god of wisdom and freshwater. Their offspring would populate the Mesopotamian pantheon.

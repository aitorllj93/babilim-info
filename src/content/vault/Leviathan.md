## Myths and Legends

**The Cosmic Battle**  
In Hebrew mythology, Leviathan was one of the primordial beings created by [[Yahweh]]. Originally, there were two Leviathans - male and female. To prevent them from multiplying and destroying the world, Yahweh slew the female and preserved her flesh for the righteous to feast upon in the messianic age.

> _"In that day the LORD with his hard and great and strong sword will punish Leviathan the fleeing serpent, Leviathan the twisting serpent, and he will slay the dragon that is in the sea."_  
> — Isaiah 27:1

**The Demonstration of Divine Power**  
In the Book of Job, Leviathan serves as [[Yahweh]]'s ultimate example of his power over creation. The detailed description of Leviathan's might and terrifying nature emphasizes that if mortals cannot stand against such a creature, they certainly cannot challenge its Creator.

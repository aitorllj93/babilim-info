## Myths and Legends

**The Táin Bó Cúailnge**
One of the most significant myths involving the Mórrígan is her interaction with [[Cú Chulainn]] during the Cattle Raid of Cooley. She offers him her love, which he rejects, leading to her interference in his battles. She appears to him in multiple forms - a young woman, an eel, a wolf, and a cow - attempting to thwart him. Despite this, she later mourns his death, perching on his shoulder in crow form.

**The Second Battle of Mag Tuired**
The Mórrígan plays a crucial role in the battle between the [[Tuatha Dé Danann]] and the [[Fomorians]]. She prophesies the battle's outcome and aids the Tuatha Dé through her powers, eventually proclaiming their victory. She is also associated with [[Dagda]], with whom she meets on Samhain before the battle.

**The Washer at the Ford**
A recurring motif is her appearance as a washer woman at a ford, cleaning the bloody clothes of those about to die in battle. This manifestation, known as the bean nighe (washing woman), became a powerful omen of death in Celtic folklore.

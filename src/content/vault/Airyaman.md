## Myths and Legends

**The Origin of Healing Plants**
When [[Angra Mainyu]] unleashed countless diseases upon the world, [[Ahura Mazda]] called upon Manthra Spenta, [[Sraosha]], and Airyaman to find cures. Through Airyaman's assistance, Ahura Mazda brought 10,000 healing plants to Earth, providing [[Thraetaona]] with the means to cure all illnesses.

**The Final Purification**
In Zoroastrian eschatology, Airyaman plays a crucial role in the world's final renovation. Together with Fire, he will melt the metals in mountains and hills, creating rivers of molten metal through which all humans must pass for purification.

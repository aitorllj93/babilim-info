## Myths and Legends

**The Disappearance of Telipinu**

The most famous myth involving Telipinu tells of his anger-fueled departure from the world. In his absence, all fertility ceased - crops withered, animals stopped reproducing, and both gods and humans faced starvation. The myth describes the devastating effects:

> "Mist seized the windows. Smoke seized the house. On the hearth the logs were stifled. On the altars the gods were stifled. In the fold the sheep were stifled. In the corral the cows were stifled. The sheep refused her lamb. The cow refused her calf."

After failed attempts by various gods to find him, the mother goddess Hannahanna sent a bee to locate Telipinu. The bee found him asleep, stung him awake, and smeared him with wax. This only angered Telipinu further, causing floods and destruction. Finally, the goddess Kamrušepa used magic to calm his anger, sending it to the Underworld in bronze containers. Upon his return, fertility was restored to the world.

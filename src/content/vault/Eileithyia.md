## Myths and Legends

**The Birth of Apollo and Artemis**  
One of the most famous myths involving Eileithyia tells of [[Hera]]'s attempt to prevent [[Leto]] from giving birth to [[Apollo]] and [[Artemis]]. Hera detained Eileithyia on Olympus, preventing her from attending to Leto, who was thus unable to deliver her children. Only when the other goddesses sent [[Iris]] with a special necklace to bribe Eileithyia did she come to assist, allowing Leto to finally give birth.

**The Birth of Heracles**  
Another significant myth involves the birth of [[Heracles]]. [[Hera]], jealous of Zeus's infidelity with [[Alcmene]], commanded Eileithyia to cross her legs and clasp her hands, magically preventing Alcmene from giving birth. This spell was broken only when [[Galanthis]], Alcmene's servant, tricked Eileithyia by announcing the birth had already occurred.

> *"And her knees were loosed."* - A common phrase in ancient texts describing Eileithyia's aid in childbirth

- Her role in the birth of various heroes and gods
- The establishment of her sacred caves in Crete
- Her association with the Moirai (Fates) in determining birth outcomes

##  Introduction
Jörmungandr, the World Serpent, stands as one of the most formidable entities in Norse mythology. Born of the trickster god Loki and the giantess Angrboða, this colossal serpent grew to such immense proportions that it encircles the entire world of Midgard, holding its own tail in an eternal grasp. As Thor's greatest adversary and a harbinger of Ragnarök, Jörmungandr embodies both cosmic order and chaos <mcreference link="https://www.ancient-origins.net/myths-legends-europe/jormungandr-0017235" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Fishing Trip**
In one of the most famous myths, Thor goes fishing with the giant Hymir and uses an ox head as bait to catch Jörmungandr. When Thor finally hooks the serpent and pulls it to the surface, Hymir, terrified of the consequences, cuts the fishing line, allowing the creature to sink back into the depths <mcreference link="https://blog.vkngjewelry.com/en/jormungandr/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The Giant Cat**
In another tale, Thor encounters Jörmungandr disguised as a cat in Útgarða-Loki's hall. When challenged to lift the cat, Thor can only raise one paw off the ground, unknowingly attempting to lift the World Serpent itself <mcreference link="https://www.odinscave.com/blogs/norse-mythology-gods/jormungandr-the-serpent-of-midgard" index="4">4</mcreference>.

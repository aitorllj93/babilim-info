In Orphic mythology, Ananke emerged at the dawn of creation alongside Chronos. Together, they encircled the cosmic egg in serpentine form, their coils crushing it and splitting it into earth, heaven, and sea, thus creating the ordered universe.

Plato, in his "Republic," describes Ananke's cosmic throne, around which the universe revolves. At her feet sit the three Moirai (Fates), her daughters, who help her maintain the cosmic order.

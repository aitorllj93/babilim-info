## Introduction
Yam (also known as Yamm) was the powerful Canaanite god of the sea and rivers, representing the primordial forces of chaos and water. As the son of [[El]], he was chosen as the divine ruler of the gods, though his reign was marked by tyranny. His epic battle with [[Baal]] for supremacy forms a central part of Canaanite mythology, particularly in the Baal Cycle, where he embodies the untamed might of the seas <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Yamm/" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Kingship**
In the Baal Cycle, El initially grants Yam kingship over the gods, bestowing upon him the title "Beloved of El." However, Yam's rule becomes tyrannical, forcing the other gods to labor under his harsh governance <mcreference link="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Yam_(god)" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**The Battle with Baal**
The most famous myth involving Yam is his conflict with Baal for divine supremacy. When Yam demands Baal's submission and threatens the divine assembly, Baal challenges him. With weapons crafted by [[Kothar|Kothar-wa-Khasis]], Baal eventually defeats Yam, though the sea god's power is never completely destroyed <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baal_Cycle" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**The Seduction of Asherah**
In one version of the myth, [[Asherah]] attempts to placate Yam's tyranny by offering herself to him, an act that provokes Baal's wrath and leads to the confrontation between the two deities.

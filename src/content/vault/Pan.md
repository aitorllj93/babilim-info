## Myths and Legends

**The Creation of the Pan Flute**
One of the most famous myths involves Pan's pursuit of the nymph [[Syrinx]]. Fleeing his advances, she begged [[Zeus]] for help and was transformed into river reeds. When Pan's breath blew across the broken reeds, they produced a haunting melody, inspiring him to create the pan flute <mcreference link="https://greekgodsandgoddesses.net/gods/pan/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Origin of Panic**
Pan was known for causing sudden fear in people and animals, particularly during the quiet afternoon hours when he was believed to rest. His terrifying shout could cause masses to flee in unreasoning fear, giving us the word "panic" <mcreference link="https://olympioi.com/demigods/pan" index="3">3</mcreference>.

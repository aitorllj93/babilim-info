## Introduction

Danu is a primordial goddess in Vedic and Hindu mythology, revered as the divine embodiment of the primeval waters and the progenitor of the powerful race known as the Danavas <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danu_(Hinduism)" index="1">1</mcreference>. She represents the chaotic yet fertile aspects of the universe, standing as one of the most ancient deities mentioned in the Rigveda <mcreference link="https://www.ramana-maharshi.org/danu-the-mother-of-the-danavas-in-hindu-mythology/" index="2">2</mcreference>. Her significance lies in her dual nature as both a life-giving force and a mother of beings who would challenge the cosmic order, making her a complex figure that embodies the eternal struggle between creation and destruction in Hindu cosmology.

## Myths and Legends

**The Mother of Vritra**  
In the Rigveda (I.32.9), Danu is identified as the mother of Vritra, the great serpent-demon slain by [[Indra]] <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danu_(Hinduism)" index="1">1</mcreference>. This myth establishes her as the progenitor of forces that challenge the divine order, positioning her offspring in eternal conflict with the Devas.

**The Hundred Sons of Danu**  
According to the Padma Purana, from her union with the sage [[Kashyapa]], Danu obtained a hundred sons, with Vipracitti being their chief <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danu_(Hinduism)" index="1">1</mcreference>. These Danavas became a powerful race often in conflict with the Devas, representing the eternal cosmic struggle between order and chaos.

**The Practice of Maya**  
The Brahmanda Purana states that while [[Aditi]] is habitually righteous and [[Diti]] habitually strong, Danu habitually practices maya (illusion) <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danu_(Hinduism)" index="1">1</mcreference>, emphasizing her association with the deceptive and changeable nature of water and primordial forces.

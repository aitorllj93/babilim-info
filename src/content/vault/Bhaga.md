##  Introduction
Bhaga is a prominent Vedic deity revered as the god of wealth and prosperity in ancient Hindu tradition <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaga" index="1">1</mcreference>. As one of the Ādityas, the celestial sons of [[Aditi]], Bhaga embodies the divine principle of fair distribution and serves as the cosmic overseer who ensures that all beings receive their appropriate share of life's bounties <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaga" index="1">1</mcreference>. His significance extends beyond material wealth to encompass marital happiness, spiritual prosperity, and the fundamental cosmic order that governs abundance and fortune.

- **Symbolic or metaphoric implications**: The etymology reflects the fundamental concept of divine distribution and the responsibility of leadership to share wealth among followers, similar to the English "lord" from "hlaford" (bread-warden) <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaga" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Myths and Legends

**The Great Distribution**  
In Rigvedic hymns, particularly RV 7.41, Bhaga is invoked approximately 60 times alongside other major deities including [[Agni]], [[Indra]], [[Mitra]]-[[Varuna]], the [[Ashvins]], [[Pushan]], [[Brahmanaspati]], [[Soma]], and [[Rudra]] <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaga" index="1">1</mcreference>. This hymn emphasizes his role as the cosmic distributor who ensures fair allocation of wealth and prosperity among all beings.

> *"In the Rigveda, the personification is occasionally intentionally ambiguous, as in RV 5.46 where men are portrayed as requesting the Bhaga to share in bhaga"*  
> — Rigvedic analysis <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaga" index="1">1</mcreference>

**The Loss of Vision**  
One significant myth tells of Bhaga losing his eyes during a cosmic conflict, symbolizing the loss of divine insight that occurs when wealth is misused or hoarded rather than distributed justly <mcreference link="https://www.ramana-maharshi.org/bhaga-the-vedic-god-of-wealth-and-prosperity/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Solar Associations**  
In RV 1.123, [[Ushas]] (Dawn) is described as Bhaga's sister, while RV 1.136 mentions that Bhaga's eye is adorned with rays, connecting him to solar symbolism and the morning sun <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhaga" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Creation**  
The establishment of Serapis's cult was a masterpiece of religious and political engineering. According to tradition, Ptolemy I had a divine vision instructing him to bring a colossal statue from Sinope to Alexandria. This statue, modified to include Egyptian elements, became the definitive image of Serapis <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Serapis/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

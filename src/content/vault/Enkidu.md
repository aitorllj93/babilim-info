## Myths and Legends

**Creation and Early Life**  
Enkidu was created by [[Aruru]] from clay at the behest of the gods to rival [[Gilgamesh]]'s strength and curb his oppressive rule. He lived among wild animals, protecting them from hunters and living in harmony with nature <mcreference link="https://www.ancient.eu/Enkidu/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

**Civilization and Transformation**  
When [[Gilgamesh]] learned of Enkidu's existence, he sent [[Shamhat]], a temple priestess, to civilize him. Through her influence and intimate companionship, Enkidu learned human ways, including speech, clothing, and bread and wine consumption <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/enkidu/" index="3">3</mcreference>.

**Adventures with Gilgamesh**  
After an initial confrontation that ended in mutual respect, Enkidu and [[Gilgamesh]] became inseparable friends. Together they:
- Defeated [[Humbaba]] in the Cedar Forest
- Slew the Bull of Heaven sent by [[Ishtar]]
- Embarked on numerous heroic quests

**Death and Legacy**  
Enkidu's death, decreed by the gods as punishment for slaying [[Humbaba]] and the Bull of Heaven, became the catalyst for [[Gilgamesh]]'s quest for immortality. His passing represents one of literature's earliest and most moving descriptions of grief and mortality.

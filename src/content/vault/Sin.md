## Myths and Legends

**Birth of the Moon God**  
According to myth, Sin was born to [[Enlil]] and [[Ninlil]] in the underworld, after Enlil was banished there for seducing Ninlil. His mother followed Enlil into the underworld, ensuring that her "bright seed" could rise to the heavens <mcreference link="https://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Sin_(mythology)" index="5">5</mcreference>.

**The Divine Family**  
As father of [[Shamash]] and [[Ishtar]], Sin formed part of the powerful astral triad that governed the heavens. Interestingly, in Mesopotamian cosmology, the moon (Sin) was considered the father of the sun (Shamash), reflecting the cultural importance of lunar timekeeping <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/Nanna/" index="2">2</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Twin Stars**
Azizos and his twin brother [[Arsu]] were venerated as the divine personifications of the morning and evening star. While Azizos rode forth as the herald of dawn, his brother guided travelers through the evening hours. Their complementary roles reflected the dual appearance of Venus in the sky.

**Divine Horseman**
In Palmyrene art, Azizos was often depicted as a mounted warrior, distinguishing him from his camel-riding brother [[Arsu]]. This iconography emphasized his role as a dynamic celestial force and connected him to the martial aspects later recognized in his identification with [[Ares]].

## Myths and Legends

**The Golden Hand**  
According to tradition, Hubal's statue was made of red agate, but its right hand was broken off. The Quraysh replaced it with a hand of gold, symbolizing both their devotion and wealth.

**Abdul Muttalib's Vow**  
A significant tale involves Muhammad's grandfather Abdul Muttalib, who vowed to sacrifice one of his ten children. Consulting Hubal's arrows for divine guidance, the arrows pointed to his son Abdullah, Muhammad's future father. Abdullah was ultimately spared when 100 camels were sacrificed in his place.

## Myths and Legends

**Marriage of Heaven and Earth**  
In Roman mythology, Terra Mater was sometimes portrayed as the consort of Caelus (Sky), reflecting the ancient Indo-European theme of the sacred marriage between Sky Father and Earth Mother. Their union was seen as the source of all life.

**The Fordicidia Festival**  
One of the most important myths associated with Terra Mater involves the origin of the Fordicidia festival. During a time of agricultural crisis, the prophet Numa was told in a dream that Terra Mater demanded pregnant cow sacrifices to ensure fertility for both land and people.

**Guardian of the Dead**  
As the receiver of the dead, Terra Mater was believed to take the deceased back into her womb, completing the cycle of life. This role was acknowledged in funeral rites where the phrase "sit tibi terra levis" (may the earth rest lightly upon you) was commonly used.

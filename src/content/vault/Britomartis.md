## Myths and Legends

**The Pursuit of Minos**  
The most famous myth of Britomartis tells of her pursuit by King Minos of Crete. For nine months, she fled from his unwanted advances across the island. Finally, to escape him, she leaped from a high cliff into the sea. She fell into fishermen's nets, which saved her life. For her preservation of chastity, [[Artemis]] granted her divine status.

> *"But those men who tell the tale that she has been named Dictynna because she fled into some fishermen's nets when she was pursued by Minos, who would have ravished her, have missed the truth; for it is not a probable story that the goddess should ever have got into so helpless a state that she would have required the aid that men can give, being as she is the daughter of the greatest one of the gods."*
— Diodorus Siculus

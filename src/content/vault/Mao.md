## Myths and Legends

**Guardian of the Sacred Seed**  
In Zoroastrian cosmogony, Mao plays a crucial role as the protector of the primordial bull's cithra (sacred essence or seed). When [[Ahriman]] and [[Jeh]] slew the primordial bovine Gavaevodata, its essence was purified and placed in the moon's care, where it became the prototype for all animal life <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**Celestial Cycles**  
According to ancient texts, [[Ahura Mazda]] himself causes the moon's waxing and waning, while the [[Amesha Spentas]] distribute its light evenly across the earth. The [[Fravashis]] are responsible for keeping the moon and stars on their appointed courses <mcreference link="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mah" index="1">1</mcreference>.

## Myths and Legends

**The Fordicidia Festival**
One of the most important festivals dedicated to Tellus was the Fordicidia, celebrated on April 15. Pregnant cows were sacrificed to ensure fertility for both the earth and the Roman people. The unborn calves were burned and their ashes were later used by the Vestals in purification rituals.

**Marriage and the Earth**
In Roman marriage ceremonies, Tellus was invoked alongside [[Ceres]] and other deities to bless the union with fertility. Newly married couples would touch the earth as part of their wedding ritual, acknowledging Tellus's power over fertility and new life.

**The Sementivae**
This agricultural festival, shared between [[Ceres]] and Tellus, celebrated the sowing of seeds. Farmers would offer sacrifices to Tellus before planting, seeking her blessing for a bountiful harvest.

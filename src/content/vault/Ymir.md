##  Introduction
Ymir, also known as Aurgelmir among the frost giants, was the primordial being of Norse mythology whose sacrificial dismemberment by [[Odin]] and his brothers created the physical world. As a manifestation of the Proto-Indo-European [[*Yemo]], his cosmic sacrifice established the foundation of the Norse universe and exemplified the ancient pattern of creation through divine dismemberment.

## Myths and Legends

**The First Being**  
In the beginning, in the vast void of Ginnungagap, where heat from Muspelheim met the frost of Niflheim, Ymir emerged from the melting ice. He was nourished by the primordial cow Auðumbla, who herself fed on the salty ice blocks. While Ymir slept, the sweat from his body gave birth to the first frost giants.

**The Cosmic Sacrifice**  
The grandsons of Búri ([[Odin]], Vili, and Vé) slew Ymir, and from his massive body, they created the world:
- His flesh became the earth
- His blood formed the seas and waters
- His bones made the mountains
- His hair became the trees
- His skull formed the dome of the sky
- His brains became the clouds
- His eyebrows formed Midgard, the realm of humans

**The Great Flood**  
When Ymir was slain, his blood flowed in such torrents that it drowned almost all the frost giants, except for Bergelmir and his wife, who escaped in a hollow log and became the progenitors of a new race of giants.

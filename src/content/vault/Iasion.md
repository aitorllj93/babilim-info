## Myths and Legends

**The Divine Love**
During the wedding feast of [[Cadmus]] and [[Harmonia]] on Samothrace, [[Demeter]] was struck by Iasion's extraordinary beauty. The goddess and the mortal hero consummated their love in a thrice-ploughed field, a union that symbolized the sacred marriage between human cultivation and divine fertility <mcreference link="https://www.theoi.com/Olympios/DemeterFamily.html" index="1">1</mcreference>.

**The Price of Divine Love**
When [[Zeus]] discovered their union, he struck Iasion down with a thunderbolt in a fit of jealousy. However, some versions, including Ovid's account, suggest that Iasion survived and lived to old age, continuing to spread agricultural knowledge and the mysteries of Demeter throughout the world <mcreference link="https://www.greeklegendsandmyths.com/iasion.html" index="3">3</mcreference>.

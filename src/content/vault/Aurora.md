## Introduction
Aurora stands as the Roman goddess of dawn, whose daily journey across the sky heralds the arrival of the morning sun. As a direct descendant of the Proto-Indo-European goddess [[*H₂éwsōs]], she shares deep mythological roots with other dawn goddesses across ancient cultures. Each morning, Aurora rides her chariot through the heavens, dispersing dew and awakening both gods and mortals to the new day.

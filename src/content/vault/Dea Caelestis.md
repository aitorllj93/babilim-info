## Myths and Legends

**The Transformation**
After Rome's conquest of Carthage, [[Tanit]]'s worship was transformed rather than suppressed. The Romans recognized in her attributes parallels with their own deities, particularly [[Juno]] and [[Venus]], leading to her elevation as Dea Caelestis.

**The Oracle of Caelestis**
Her temple in Carthage became a renowned oracle center, consulted by Romans throughout the empire. The emperor Septimius Severus particularly favored her prophecies, and her oracular powers were sought after by both common people and nobility.

**Guardian of Carthage**
Even after the Punic Wars, she was believed to continue her role as the divine protector of Carthage, now as a Roman city. Her blessing was considered essential for the city's prosperity and rain-bringing powers.

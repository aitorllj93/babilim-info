## Myths and Legends

**The Great Battle with Indra**  
The central myth of Vṛtra involves his cosmic battle with [[Indra]], the king of the devas. Vṛtra had enclosed all the world's waters within mountains, causing universal drought. Strengthened by soma and wielding his vajra (thunderbolt), Indra confronted Vṛtra. Their battle shook the cosmos until Indra finally split Vṛtra asunder, releasing the waters and establishing cosmic order.

**Birth and Origins**  
According to some traditions, Vṛtra was created by Tvaṣṭṛ, the divine craftsman, either as a son or as a specific weapon against Indra. His immense power made him a formidable opponent of the devas.

**Legacy in Indo-European Tradition**  
Vṛtra represents a particular manifestation of the Proto-Indo-European dragon [[*Ngʷhi]], sharing characteristics with other Indo-European serpent adversaries like:
- Jörmungandr in Norse mythology
- Typhon in Greek mythology
- Azi Dahaka in Iranian mythology

## Cultural Significance

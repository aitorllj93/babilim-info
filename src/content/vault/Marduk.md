## Myths and Legends

**The Enuma Elish**
In this central creation epic, Marduk defeats [[Tiamat]], the primordial goddess of salt water and chaos. Using the four winds, he traps her, splits her body in two with an arrow, and from her corpse creates heaven and earth. He then organizes the universe, establishes the celestial bodies, and creates humanity from the blood of [[Kingu]], Tiamat's general.

> _"He split her like a shellfish into two parts:
> Half of her he set up and cemented as the sky,
> Pulled down the bar and posted guards."_

## Archaeological Evidence

**The Temple Repository Finds**  
The primary evidence comes from the Temple Repositories at Knossos, where two significant faience figurines were discovered <mcreference link="https://pantheon.org/articles/m/minoan_snake_goddess.html" index="2">2</mcreference>:

1. The Larger Figure:
- Snakes crawling up her arms
- Bare breasts with serpents
- Cylindrical crown
- Sacred knot at waist

2. The Smaller Figure:
- Holds snakes in raised hands
- Cat/panther on headdress
- Partially reconstructed

**Material Significance**  
The figurines are made of faience, a crushed quartz-paste material that produces a vitreous finish with bright colors. This material choice is significant as it symbolized the renewal of life in ancient cultures <mcreference link="https://www.worldhistory.org/image/398/minoan-snake-goddess-knossos/" index="4">4</mcreference>.

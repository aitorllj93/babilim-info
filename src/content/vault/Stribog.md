## Myths and Legends

**Master of the Eight Winds**  
Stribog was known as the grandfather of the eight directional winds, each represented by one of his grandchildren. These winds could bring either blessing or destruction, depending on Stribog's will. The western winds were known for their gentleness and life-giving properties, while the northern winds were fierce and unpredictable.

**Seasonal Transitions**  
In Slavic mythology, Stribog played a crucial role in the changing of seasons. He carried [[Vesna]] and [[Jarilo]] during the spring equinox to defeat [[Marzanna]], the goddess of winter. Conversely, in autumn, he would carry [[Marzanna]] back to reclaim her domain, demonstrating his impartial role in the natural cycle.

**The Divine Wind-Caller**  
Stribog was believed to reside on a sacred island at the center of the Earth, from where he directed his grandchildren - the winds - to all corners of the world. With his great horn, he could summon any wind at will, controlling the weather patterns that affected both agriculture and seafaring.

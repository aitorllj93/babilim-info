## Myths and Legends

**Birth from Nine Mothers**  
Heimdall was born in a remarkable fashion from nine sisters who were likely wave maidens or daughters of the sea. His mothers were named Gjolp, Greip, Eistla, Eyrgjafa, Ulfrun, Angeyja, Imth, Atla, and Jarnsaxa. This unique birth from the waves of the cosmic sea imbued him with powers of both sea and earth.

**The Creation of Social Classes**  
As Rig (Rígr), Heimdall wandered Midgard and fathered the three classes of human society:

- Thralls (slaves)
- Karls (free peasants)
- Jarls (nobles)
  Through this myth, he is considered the father of mankind and the establisher of social order.

**The Battle with Loki**  
Heimdall and Loki maintained a deep antagonism, once fighting in the form of seals over Freyja's necklace Brísingamen. Their rivalry is fated to reach its climax during Ragnarök, where they are destined to slay each other as the world burns.

## Role in Ragnarök

Heimdall's most crucial role comes at Ragnarök, the twilight of the gods. When he perceives the approach of the giants and enemies of the gods, he will sound his Gjallarhorn, alerting all beings in the Nine Worlds to the beginning of the final battle. In the ensuing conflict, he and his eternal rival Loki are destined to kill each other.

---

## Modern Interpretations

Heimdall represents the archetype of the eternal guardian and sentinel. His placement at the rainbow bridge between realms suggests his role as a mediator between the divine and mortal worlds. His creation of social classes, while problematic to modern sensibilities, historically served to explain and justify social structures in Norse society.

##  Introduction
Apsu (also known as Abzu in Sumerian) was the primordial god of fresh water in Mesopotamian mythology. Together with his consort [[Tiamat]], the salt water goddess, he represented the original creative forces from which all the gods emerged. His significance in Mesopotamian cosmogony is primarily known through the Babylonian creation epic, the Enuma Elish, where his conflict with the younger gods leads to his eventual defeat by [[Ea]].

## Myths and Legends

**The Enuma Elish**  
In the Babylonian creation epic, Apsu and [[Tiamat]] initially coexisted, their waters mingling to create the first generation of gods. However, Apsu became disturbed by the noise and movement of these younger deities and plotted with his vizier [[Mummu]] to destroy them. This plan was discovered by [[Ea]], who put Apsu into a deep sleep and killed him, establishing his own dwelling upon Apsu's body.

**The Creation of the Abzu**  
After Apsu's death, [[Ea]] established his home in the Abzu, making it his sacred realm where he would later father [[Marduk]]. The Abzu became an important cosmic location, particularly associated with wisdom, magic, and purification rituals.

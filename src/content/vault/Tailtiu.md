## Myths and Legends

**The Great Clearing**  
According to the Lebor Gabála Érenn, after the First Battle of Mag Tuired, Tailtiu came to Coill Cuan and undertook the massive task of clearing the forest. Through her extraordinary effort, she transformed dense woodland into a plain covered with clover flowers within a year, creating Ireland's first agricultural land.

**The Foster Mother of Lugh**  
Despite being of the Fir Bolg, Tailtiu became foster mother to [[Lugh]] of the Tuatha Dé Danann, demonstrating the sacred bonds that transcended tribal divisions. Her nurturing of Lugh, who would become one of Ireland's greatest heroes, shows her pivotal role in bridging different mythological cycles.

**The Sacred Sacrifice**  
The clearing of Ireland's plains proved to be Tailtiu's final act. The immense labor exhausted her, and she died at her fortress in the place that now bears her name. Before her death, she requested that funeral games be held in her memory, establishing a tradition that would continue for centuries.
